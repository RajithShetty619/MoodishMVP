Must try.\n.\nNext ordered pasta garlic cheese - this is not for people who love cheesy white pasta. As it has many vegetables and it is not very cheesy. It is healthy pasta. Whole wheat penne pasta with broccoli, jalapeno, zucchini, olives etc. The pasta is accompanied by lavash crackers. Loved this too. Crispy cracker with white pasta :) :D\n.\nThere are many seasonal juices too. They have even mentioned the benefits of the fruits used in the juice. Loved the concept of healthy food.

The cheese dip went great with it. \n\n▪️Bbq Chicken Pizza:\n7 inch pizza topped with BBQ chicken, corn and Jalapeno was made to perfection. The chicken was juicy and the cheese was amazing. \n\n▪️Classic Pepperoni Pizza:\nGenerous quantity of cheese was topped with the pepperoni. It was tasty and delicious. \n\n▪️Butterscotch Blizzard:\nNew in their dessert menu so gave it a try and was not disappointed. It was very similar to a butterscotch cake and completed out whole meal. \n\nMOJO always delivers the pizza hot, fresh and on time. It is one of the best places for pizza cravings. \nThey also have great offers that continuously goes on which is great.",

Mojo does not provide a bag anyways. And the choco lava cake he brought had spilled as it was lying clumsily at the bottom with onions and veggies on top of it. \n\nI make it a point to wash all the veggies received as they are all touched by hand. Do u expect me to wash the choco lava cake? \nThis executive argued that he sanitized his hands at the store.

Desserts very absolutely fantastic and delicious too. Carrot cake with orange is a must try. Also dark chocolate with nuts was very nice. Icecream was good.

Amazing place to hang out with your friends and colleagues for sure. As it is located in Bandra, near corporate hub of BKC, it is crowded place. But the food and drinks severed here, makes it more crowded. \n\nThe venue is separated in two as lounge and restaurant. Continuous music will surely make you more relax than ever. Plus, humble staff makes you more comfortable. \n\nDrinks we ordered are \n\nBellini, sparkling wine with blended peach puree. The Seven Island Ice Tea, a perfect mixture of 7 prominent liquors like gin vodka, tequila, rum and juices. Nojito Kiwi, freshly blended kiwi mixed with citrus syrup and minty lemonade. Citrus Cooler (Pineapple), fab mixture of pineapple juice with aerated lemon juice.\n\nFood we ordered are,\n\nMurg Abadhi Tikka, marinated in pickling spices and deep-fried boneless chicken pieces. Lord of The Wings, spice marinated and deep-fried chicken wings. Spaghetti Aglio E Olio, spaghetti noodles pasta cooked in olive oil, garnished with herbs and served in red sauce with chicken. Regular French Fries with tomato ketchup. Cheese cake with sparkle of coco powder as a dessert.\n\nLocation: 5/5\nAmbiance: 4/5\nCuisine: 5/5\nDrinks: 5/5",

The pleasent and look lights will definitely wins your hearts. The food is mind blowing. The starters were superb, The garnishing of the food is perfect. Talking about the presentation actually I am speechless bcoz I have never seen this perfection.\nThe service given was equivalent to a 5 start hotel service. The waiters were claim and ready to help and it was quite good to have dine there. The prices were also pocket friendly. Talking about the quantity and quality it is worth the price. I wonder how difficult it must be for them to be consistent, but the fact is that they are consistent when it comes to taste.",

This rice also includes 3-4 boiled eggs along with some salad which includes carrot, onion and tomato. Instead of serving it in a plate or a medium sized utensil, they prefer to serve it in a big thali which gives you the feel of eating like a nawab or a Mughal. The kepsa rice is served in two proportions half and the other one is the full. Half kepsa is ample enough for serving 2-3 people while full on the other hand can easily serve 5 people.  They do have 2 sections ac and non ac. Ac section is located besides the restaurant and goes under the name of Mao Chinese centre.  Talking about the hygiene part, it is below average, so just in case if you’re looking for an hygienic place this is not the right place to be. Instead you can opt for takeaway option which is must better than eating at that particular restaurant. They do serve different types of deserts as well of which caramel custard is the best out of all the deserts served over here.",

There is a small stage that is there and a DJ section to the left after entering near the bar. There are limited toilets so when it’s a larger crowd this is something to be mindful about. There are many interesting design elements that make up the space. Some brilliant wall decor and lighting. \n\nFood: (4/5)\nThe buffet menu was extremely good. I was especially surprised by the quality of the fried rice. It had a really great flavour and just get light. The other dishes were also great, but nothing compared to the friend rice. The cake for dessert was also quite good, not too sweet, but still rich in flavour. \n\nSummary: (4/5)\nGood place in Belapur to drop by with friends or office colleagues.

I went there at the perfect time, around late afternoon and the sea view added to the already exquisite ambience.\nStarted with a delicious cup of coffee with helped me cope with all the air sickness from the flight.\nI had Veg exotic pizza and Caesar salad. Both were equally good. \nThe pizza was the best I had in a long long time. Regular pizza, not even thin crust and yet so good \n\nSame stands for salad. A good amount with ample amount of chicken and with no added extra sauces and unwanted fat. \n\nEnded with a soothing cold coffee. Very glad. :)\n\n5/5 for everything.\nWould surely love to visit again ❤️",

I especially loved the Yemeni Mandi which was lightly smoked and had incredible flavor. Especially the rice had a perfect smoky flavor and the lamb was a tender accompaniment. The rich baklava we shared for dessert was a wonderful end to the meal, sprinkled with the shattered petals of a nitrogen-frozen rose!",

Take your own risk when you order food from here. They don't follow any social distancing and neither check customers for temp.  For your own safety and health, avoid the place. The lady sitting in the counter is most rude one I have ever met in this business. Huge health hazard. Kitchen is very dirty if you get a chance to peen from the next door or from cash counter.",

Very attractive moktail for pictures clicking. Balance sweetness & was perfectly prepared.\n\n2️⃣-Next i tried garlic bread there were 4 pieces in a plate and garlic bread was too tasty n soft the size of the bread was quiet large but they don provide u any sauses or chutney with it. As the taste is little different so you can enjoy without chutney or any sauces\n\n3️⃣:-Then i tried chiken platter it was very very mouth watering cheese 🧀 was topped over it  platter was garnished with some carrot and cabbage also a bowl of green chutney the chiken was very soft and marinated with garlic 🧄 ginger paste along with some spices in it we luved it i would like to rate 10 out 10 to this chiken platter\n\n4️⃣- And the last i ordered chicken crispy tempting 🤩🤑 and this chicken crispy was garnished with coriander . I like the taste was not so spicy u can have it some szhewan sause as per your taste or its a good option to start your dinner 🥘\n\n➡️Ambience-  It's  an Indo-western fusion restaurant and bar.They have an outside seating as well as well-decorated dim indoor ambience with full of load music with attracts so much.\none of those places which has a really quirky ambience and a unique way of serving food.\n\nAmbience-5/5\nService-5/5\nTaste-5/5\nworth for money-5/5",

A small yet a cozy place for your taste buds to relish on the stuffed aloo Parathas, paneer Parathas , sattu Parathas and what not. The green chutney they serve along with the Parathas is just too fabulous for the tongue. The place has line of healthy fruit juices and milkshakes at to appetize your thirst. In short it is a world of good at reasonably low prices. The only thing I would suggest is them to add Litti Chokha to their menu because I love it very very much.",

One of the wall that is covered with plates and bowls, looks impressive.\n\nBeing a weekday, the footfall was moderate, so fortunately we received a wonderful hospitality. They have ample staff to handle big numbers on any given day. For food we totally relied on our table captain. Right from the juices till the desserts, we loved almost everything we had.\n\nLets come to food now:\nOff the mark, we started with juices. Ordered for Cocktail, Orange and Watermelon. All these were amazingly refreshing, but I would recommend Cocktail juice if one would like to have tangy and sweet taste. Also tried Sweet Lassi and Kesar Lassi, Sweet Lassi was yum and thick.\n\nNext we headed to their soup section,\nWe ordered for Palak soup, Sweet corn soup and Manchow soup. Here, according to me, sweet corn and Manchow soup was nothing different from what we usually have at different places, but if you are a spinach lover, then definitely try creamy spinach soup.\n\nComing to the starters:\nHere comes Paneer Koliwada, Spicy chilly Manchurian dry, Corn Palak Kebab, Mushroom Tikka and hara bhara kebab.\nSpicy Chilly manchurian tasted well, the presentation was good, it was served in a wheat basket.\nMushroom Tikka was well marinated, very juicy from inside and delicious(Recommended)\nBut the spotlight was on Paneer Koliwada, everyone loved it that we asked for one more serving.(Recommended)\n\nFor the main course we ordered for Veg Maratha, Paneer Khurchan, Dal Makhani and Dal Tadka.\nDal Makhani was amazing. Paneer Khurchan was fine but Veg Maratha is a definite show stopper, perfectly spiced, flavourful and aromatic, loved it.\n\nFor the desserts we ordered for Rabdi with Gulab Jamun and Chef Special Dessert of the day.\nChef special was really special. This dessert was served in a fruit salad bowl, it had yummy brownie crushed along with dry fruits and fruits.( Recommended).\n\nOverall the experience at this place was good considering that I am a hardcore Non-veg lover.\nThe menu is set Moderately priced. Will visit again for sure!!!!!!!!!",

When looking at it from the outside, it looks like the perfect fine dining place with just the right amount of elegance. However, once you step inside, it is more casual and less business like. I was here with a group of friends and we had quite a few things here.\n\nWe started off with the Avocado Toastie which was crispy and delicious. A base of toast with guacamole is essentially what it was. It was bite sized and tasted pretty good but it wasn't extraordinary. It was not something that you would get a craving for, in the middle of the night.\n\nThe Botanical Bloom Bread was a delight. A huge loaf of bread was buttered up and stuffed with molten cheese and a flavor of garlic. It was crispy and the cheese sauce was just amazing. Bread and cheese is something that one can't really go wrong with and it was perfect here.\n\nWe even tried the Crispy Lotus Stem. It was slightly sweet and sticky. However, it tasted okay. The stem became chewy very quickly and it wasn't at par with the ones that I have had but it was a good effort.\n\nWe went for the Veg Exotica Pizza. It was loaded with veggies as the description stated and it was crispy, spicy and delicious. The toppings were good and it was well balanced with the amount of cheese. When it comes to pizza, the proportion matters and the proportion for this one was completely right.\n\nLastly, we tried the Avocado, Asparagus and Cream Cheese sushi. It was put together well and rolled up in white sticky rice with a slightly crisp centre of the avocado and asparagus. It was served with soya sauce and wasabi. The taste was almost perfect but it needed a bit more binding when it comes to flavor.\n\nThe place is decent and worth a shot if you like the way it looks. They have some unique dishes on their menu which are really good. They could work a bit more on enhancing their flavors and it could surely be on my list of the places to visit!\n\nAmbience: 4/5\nFood: 4/5\nService: 4/5",

I visited botanica with a group of girl friends and suffice to say that we couldn't be happier. \nBrand new, Botanica is so ideally located near Girgaum Chowpatty. It offers no booze and no meat. That is where the beauty starts.\nThey have an extensive menu. Indian, asian, continental and even fusion.\nAll mocktails and drinks are made with natural ingredients. Blue Pea, rosemary,thyme ,jalapenos, black tea, mint, chopped fruits ,you name it and they have a great drink.\nserved in pretty glasses, the drinks all taste good. Since we were so many, we could order different drinks and taste almost everything on the menu.\nWe tried Mexican Tomato soup, Miso and Green Latte. My miso soup had shitake . Well made and light.\nThe Asian delight was glass noodles in a mason jar. The wow factor was the smoke. And the smoke was in the cold salad. Each element....even the sesame seeds was so well flavoured. try the Mushrooms and mango or watermelon and feta salad if youre not keen on keeping it fresh and simple.\nZucchini cheese rolls were nice.\nThe assorted savoury cakes were a take on the kothambir wadi...with broccoli, yam etc. SO well made and the fried garlic crumbs made it even better.\nThe icing on the cake was the Rajma Galouti. So well smoked and so well smoked. For a second, I almost thought it was keema.\nSo worth the calories. you Must try this.\nWe had a dumpling platter. The drama and the plating....full marks to the chef. I liked the mushroom dumpling the best.\nThe greek pizza was super. Thin, crisp semolina base, cheese and arugula. Adult taste and awesome.\nThe chilli bbq jack fruit and asian spiced paneer baos were nice. Im not too fond of baos, so I didnt have more than a bite.\nThe sushi burger was super jazzy to look at. And on point for the sushi rice. But the paneer could be substituted with a crunch factor. That paneer made it mushy for me.\nThe jack fruit biryani was fragrant and nice.\nAs was the makhani ravioli. Pretty ,pretty and super yum, and bang on sauce.\nThe pumpkin tortellini with foam was  nice.\nDessert... theer was a chocolate with lemon grass pudding. I didnt get any lemon grass taste , but because I was full already, I didnt really miss the dessert. The basundi with rose balls...basundi with rooh afza caviar was nice.\n\nA lot of chatting, good food and good times. And we took loads of pictures that I had to share. Go here and try all the chefs and servers recommend. They know their food\n\nGo to botanica for a good time with family and friends.",

The Botanica is located in cherni road, and its 10 minutes walking from the cherni road railway station. The place can be easily located on Google map as well.\n\nThe has really nice and cosy Ambiance with really cute sitting arrangement. The round tables, sofas and amazing dining experience. They also have different country clock displayed just to have a feel of international cuisines. The ambiance is really calm. The best part about the Botanica is their hospitality and lip smacking food. They have sitting capacity of around 80-100 people. The food can be at your table within 5 to 6 minutes after ordering.\n\nThe classy Ambiance and delicious food with super friendly and humble staff makes this place perfect for a meal with a family and friends. In the menu, around 90% of the dishes can be made jain.\n\nWe tried,\nMocktails: their range of Mocktails are really refreshing and amazing. As per their recommendation we tried Botanical martini, Miss mary. And bang on both were really amazing. The taste of jalapeño in martini was coming out well, the smoky flavor was good in miss mary. Overall both were really refreshing. \n\nMexican tomato soup: A perfect start of a meal was a soup. All the flavors were coming out really nicely. The spicy, the tangy, little sweet. A perfect which can increase your craving. The soup had nachos and beans. A must try soup. \n\nCorn cottage cheese seekh: the kabab was perfectly cooked. The smokey flavors along with the flavor of corn and lots of cheese. The kabab was served along with cabbage and bell pepper salad and mint chutney. This was not that spicy. But was really soft. \n\nAsian spiced cottage cheese: again a perfect apittizer.. The rich red gravy of cashew and tomatoes along with small dices of cottage cheese and bell pepper. The perfect in taste and texture. The cheese was marinated properly and the balance flavors along with the drink was pure heaven. \n\nArancini cheese poppers: this was something new in arancini. The cheesy poppers along with the salsa sauce and cheese cream. The best presented dish. The perfectly cheesy balls going well with the tomato salsa. \n\nIn main course we wanted to try their kofta, as it was suggested by the staff. The kofta had a rich red thick gravy along with the Indian spices. The kofta was made-up from paneer and herbs. The quantity was sufficient. And can be eaten with Roti or biryani. We had missi roti, tandoori roti and Nawabi biryani.\n\nThe biryani was really rich and royal. The flavors were really amazing. Little more spicy then expected, but tasted really well. The rice was cooked properly and was not dry. The veg biryani lovers must try this here. the Indian herbs has enhanced the taste of the biryani. \n\nThe last segment was THE DESSERTS \nTiramisu: the mascarpone cheese along with vanilla cake and a strong flavor of coffee. This was mesmerizing and amazing. The taste was good. Coffee had a strong flavor in this dessert. Also, \n\nMelting chocolate cake: a melting lava cake was served along with the butterscotch ice-cream. The preparation was really like a melting chocolate. A dark flavored chocolate was just perfect and mouthwatering. \n\nGold dust Cappuccino: Heard of this, but never tasted before. The Golden sprinkle on Cappuccino. This has made our meal. The edible sprinkle was garnished on the Cappuccino. The strong Cappuccino had a great taste along with the creamy milk. A must must try drink.\n\nOverall had a great time with family. The staff has made our meal a great meal. Special thanks to @live_life_royal for amazing meal experience.",

Mr Vijay served and assisted us gratefully.\nFor starters we tried the gosht galouti and the murg pahadi kebabs. Both were intrinsically delicious and made us crave for it more. The kebabs were made perfectly with the ingredients mounted just to the mark.one of the best kebabs i had. For drinks we ordered the virgin mojito, it was refreshing and chilled.the juicy extract of lime was oozing and freezing and refreshing our minds. The Sheryl temple was also good. The lemony chilling taste made us a fan of it. The lamb messy burger was so good that im still fond of it.it was like a treat to our stomach. Personally recommended.\nIn the main course we had the murg lahori with cheese garlic naan.The chicken was cooked well and the gravy with it was delicious. If u are a chicken craver then this shud be on ur eat list. With the cheese garlic naan,it was on to a whole new level.damn it was yummy.\noverall the place is worth visiting and i wud like to visit the place again soon",

It can go up till an hour. And you have to share a table with strangers which might kind of invade your privacy. Rest everything is amazing. It's a good place to visit for having a light dinner. Sometimes you may also come across a live performance going on which is a cherry on top of the cake for it's ambience.",

I've been a frequent visitor here and I've had one hell of a night every single time I've visited this place. They've come up with this new beautiful entrance which is decorated with golden fairy lights. They have a huge green wall opposite the entrance as its selfie point. Yeda Republic is an evil styled lounge bar with space suits and dark alleys. The lounge bar is located underground in the basement with Carribean flags with life like props wearing space suits, gas masks and respiratory pipes while you walk your way down. They have huge a jeep like structure located right in the centre where cute little staff members dressed up in spacesuits dance during weekends. Dark zones, Gas chambers, Ceiling with human bodies strapped with masks, ropes, jute bags, tunnel-like entry to the restrooms, waiters dressed like prisoners in orange one-piece suits are some of the traits of this lounge. The bar counter is clearly the highlight of this place with large cylindrical pipes which drop down from the ceiling and houses the Bar Bottles, for the rest of the display. They also have a fancy telephone booth with 5 ancient telephones. Talking about the food, the menu is a little compact when it comes to food. One thing they could work on is their menu. They have a wide bar menu but only 4 mocktails and 3 desserts in all. Also, I'd recommend y'all to place your order for maincourse and desserts along with the appetizers itself as they take a while to prepare the food.\n\nWe'd ordered :\nIn Mocktails :\n1. Fruitshoot - Mixed fruits blended with sugar and vanilla ice-cream. The taste was good. If you like your drink sweet, you can opt for this one.\n\n2. Lipstick - This is a tiny glass of mocktail having a very attractive red colour consisting of orange, mint, cranberry juice and peach crush.\n\nIn Cocktails :\n1. Bloody Mary - This is our all time favorite, red colored spicy cocktail which will surely get you in the mood.\n\nIn Appetizers :\n1. Cheese Corn Nuggets - Seven pieces of nuggets having melted cheese, corn and capsicum in its filling served with a dip. They are medium spicy in taste. \n\n2. Chicken Lollipop - Six pieces of chicken legs served with green chutney. They have a tangy taste. \n\nIn Mains :\n1. Chicken Sphaghetti Pasta with Pesto Sauce - They have three options in pasta base, ie. Sphaghetti, Macaroni and Penne Pasta. We'd opted for Sphaghetti Pasta in Pesto Sauce with chicken as its add on. It's served with two long garlic breads, garnished with cheese and black olives.\n\n2. Chicken Makhani Pizza - This is a thin crust pizza which has Makhani sauce in its base topped with chicken pieces and cheese.\n\nIn Dessert :\n1. Paan Falooda - I'm a huge paan lover so went for this one. This a satiating glass of falooda with paan syrup, jelly, almonds, cashews and french vanilla ice-cream.",

Mao family restaurant is famous for its Kepsa, Mughlai, chinese, Indian, Tandoori and seafood especially  Its tasty and yummy dishes like😍 kepsa of different types, fried rice, one pot biryani, caramel pudding, rabdi and many more. I loved the fact of having a big plate of Chicken hyderabadi Kepsa with reasonable cost which increased my excitement to visit this family restaurant. I have visited this place with family and friends many times and this place has always been very near and dear to my heart.❣️ The best part is the Kepsa spcl. Every grain of rice is cooked, the chicken meat cooked fantastic nice and juicy. 🍗Right from its presentation to its apettite this dish is absolute heaven. I am very sure of going back to this place again once lockdown ends. And i really recommend to visit this restaurant because its one of the best to serve good amount of food in reasonable and affordable cost.😍🥗😋😋😋😋",

Even being a small cafe, ambience is good and well maintained. Staff is so helpful and suggests very well. \nWe had -\nCindrella - Basically a pure Kiwi juice which I never tried before. Too good. Recommended.\n.\nPan shots - 6 small shots of mint, lemon with soda. So refreshing. Something new. Highly recommended.\n.\nMangolian Pasta - Creamy pasta with some vegies. Tasted good.\n.\nMelting Grill Sandwich - This one is a must try. Filled with loads of cheese and mayo, loved it. Highly recommended.\n.\nMexican fries - French fries with cheese, tomato sauce, chili flakes and pepper was a different combination for me. Heavy one and good in taste.\n.\nMix fruit cream - The delightful creamy end to our super amazing meal. Fruit pieces like apple, pineapple, pomegranate were served with cream. Yummy. Highly recommended.\n.\nI was satisfied with all the dishes and will definitely visit again.",

The restaurant is under renovation so we were asked to sit out in the garden accompanied by stray cats, hoards of mosquitoes and flies. I don't know what was worse, the sound and smell of flies and mosquitoes being electrocuted right at our table or smell of mosquito repellent or the pieces of coal in our nan or the stale paneer or the cold chicken soup. Eventually, I suffered from food poisoning, my brother had severe acidity. So yeah, it was an ultimate letdown. Just stay clear out of this one. There are better places available If you wanna spend a premium price for a dinner with fowl and flies around you. 2 stars just because it used to be nice in the past.",

They come up with these seasonal menus which is excellent.\n\nTried a couple of dishes here from the summer and the new menu. Loved a few.\n\nDo try the Sichuan Sliders. They were delicious. Crisp patty, spicy sauce.. one lipsmacking slider. The noodle bhel salad accompanied was to die for.\n\nThe potato wedges were crisp and delicious. Loved the seasoning.\n\nCrispy cracker mousse from the summer menu.. creamy smooth Mushroom mousse and spicy guacamole topped over a crisp cracker. It was quite good. A balance of textures..  creamy, spicy, crispy and smooth.\n\nPower protein salad from the summer menu.. this salad was delicious. Loved it. Chickpeas, Arugula, almonds, edamame and quinoa with a super delicious dressing.\n\nRed and black combo from summer menu.. Manipur edamame black rice served with a coconut based chickpeas and Vegetable curry. This dish was delicious and healthy.\n\nSweet curd with mango .. from the summer menu.. a delicious yougurt with mango sorbet..I quite liked this one.\n\nChocolate Churros... Oh so good. Loved them. Do try!\nBig fat churros drizzled with dark, milk and white chocolate and served with more Chocolate sauce.\n\nPaneer Makhani sizzler... This one was decent..but my least favourite since I'm not a Makhani fan. The pulav was delicious. The paneer was melt in the mouth soft.. the gravy was a little sweet for my liking.\n\nCottage cheese rolls with Crunchy oats... These could have been better. The cottage cheese and the sauce within was delicious but the outer skin can be worked on.\n\nKashmiri kawah/twings and berries.. both the teas were good.\n\nOverall a good experience.",

It’s one thing to raise prices, but to make portions so small that they don’t even satisfy one person is really ridiculous! The pizzas are the only saving grace. Alcohol prices are also absurdly high. One can’t even enjoy a decent glass wine below Rs.1000 per glass. The management seems to have the misconception that they are some Michelin star fine dine restaurant! They need to come back to earth or people will stop patronising soon. \nThe earlier decor was bright and cheerful but now it’s become really dark and dingy, more like a lounge bar. Seriously wonder what the management is doing.",

If you consider yourself not a teenager/ you do not feel like dancing and rather sitting with your drink, you would enjoy it more on a weekday only for the fact that the music is really loud & the younger crowd is there to dance! Food is good, drinks menu is quiet big and everyone gets to pick what they like. The money that u pay is a more than what the place offers, so feels a little pricey! We ended up paying 7k for 2 dishes, couple of beer rounds and some gin!",

Lasagna is a layered dish with sauteed vegetables between the thin layers and topped with lots of chhese. To be honest, when it was served hot it was it was really fun to have the cheese pull but once it becomes cold it kind of irritates you.

I know this place since, I was a stubborn kid who often visits & live here in his elder brothers house and I know this place better than anyone who visits here. Since, Baba expanded its business and had a very successful items to have here. The very first offered here is their best & in hand item called Mixed Ice Cream Falooda with Extra Dried Fruits. Many others such as Black Current Falooda, Royal Malai Falooda & Baba Double Special Falooda with your own choices of topping given you within their branded box has a very servile appeal. I assure you that anyone who will have it here will never regret to do so here at Baba Falooda!\n\nIf it helped you some how to find about Baba Falooda! then please leave a like so that I can know that I helped you, little matters most : )",

This is one of my favorite.\n\nBut chicken curry was not up-to the mark. Chicken was half cooked and curry was also tasteless....we raise the complaint then they provided other one.\n\nAnd finally we order chicken dum biryani... Which was total disappointment....no taste again chicken half cook..... \n\nI suggest if you are planning to visit try the starters or dessert.\n\nOr  provide instructions to the cook or manager before ordering.....",

Luckily for us, our order was ready when we reached and it made a lot of difference since we didn't have to stand amongst the crowd and could stay socially distant too! \nWe ordered cheese garlic bread, plain cheese pizza, garden fresh pizza and veg supreme pizza. All were hot and fresh and absolutely yummy! Would recommend you to pre-order in case you're doing a takeaway.",

Tea is served hot throughout the day. There is air conditioned segment for those you can't sit without cool air. You get snacks, proper meal and starters through out the day. Prices are reasonable considering the quality of food and ambience. So if you are hungry and in matunga, Ganga Vihar is a place to go!",

We had been here recently again, situated@N.S. road, near Panch Rasta, Mulund West!.\n\nThe surrounding ambience has pleasing vibes & aroma is soothing too!. The decors are well lit & gives the feel of its long lavish legacy of generations!.\n\nThe staff here is very friendly & prompt while placing several orders & suggestions & serving hot too!.\nDharmendra, incharge for our table was very attentive to recommend & serve with delight!.\n\nLet's checkout the food we had ordered here, \n\nPapad Churi was totally crunchy & tossed up with onion & chaat!. You just can't stop after one bite!.. It's all time regular favourites for most of the tables!. Surely try this dish for starters!.\n\nWe next ordered Chinese Platter, it was finger licking & platter had sufficient quantity for sharing wise!. Several Chinese items include manchurian balls, Vej crispy, paneer chilli & spring rolls & salad in sidings!.\n\nWe also had Paneer Tikka Dry, it was mouthwatering to glance & craving for more!. The spices were nicely blend & paneer was coated crisply & lip smacking!.\n\nPaneer Cheese Tikka, is a nice fusion of seasoned paneer & over loaded cheese!. If you love both, surely go for this tikka, it's finger licking awesome!.\n\nBhagat Tarachand Special Thali  gives a glimpse of its succesful tradition it carries!. Balanced so well with ghee chapatis, 2 sabji of own choice, papad, dal, raita etc!. It's wholesome & flavourful by all means!.\n\nGulab Jamun is tender soft & sweet to its core, lingering sweetness for a long time to cherish!. Surely good to try Gulab Jamuns for dessert!.\n\nIcecream slice looked tempting & every slice of it was yummm!! After heavy dining, it's truly a bliss to pounce on desserts like this for sweet tooth lovers!.\n\nB Bhagat Tarachand is a proven excellence & you surely visit this place quite often to experience it's awesome treat & hospitality!. Thankyou!. ❤\n\nFood - 5/5\nAmbience - 4/5\nPrice - 4/5\nService -5/5",

We could have not explored other things. He shud have suggested as per 3 people dining. \n\nAlso i told over the phone that i need cozy place as its someones birthday but when i went they gave me place which was in front of main door.

Chicken chilly dry was good in terms of taste and portion size. But the rice was a little undone, it had a bite, I understand Chinese fried rice normally has a bite in them as they get cooked when being tossed in the wok. But here the case was different, rice tasted hard because it was undercooked. But overall I found the taste, quality and portion size good enough. Will surely order again. Btw I loved their Schezwan chutney, Im not very fond of it bcos of added colours but I tasted this and I must say its exceptional, kind off homestyle.",

Rest assured food is value for money.\n\n _Go to place_ if you're in Andheri East Near Nagardas Road, better than any other restaurant in the same category.\n\nThe staff and manager are very well mannered and will not turn down genuine complaints and requests.\nThey also take party orders and you can host a party for about 50-60 people.\n\nVery likely to be crowded slow in service on Weekend and Holiday Evenings so plan your visit well before time.",

The Murg Mussalam , butter chicken, noodles, fruit punch and other bunch of starters are perfect. But after the renovation I visited the place and I asked them what’s new food items. He said the same old dishes and when I asked what’s new other than tht, then he did not have any clue. I asked for a new kebab type starter for which he suggested chicken ghee roast. It was not good, there was no taste of ghee nor was it roasted, you can see in the picture that it wasn’t served like a kebab but like a main course side dish. Taste wasn’t upto the mark. I also ordered a fruit punch to set my mood, which was classic, tasty! But nothing new in the drink menu. For main course I ordered Chicken Patiyala, and I have to say that it was the most uninteresting looking dish I have had. Chicken patiyala consists of a base of chicken stuffed omelette which is topped with a great tasting gravy. But here at neel Kamal, it was just a plain chicken curry and they topped the whole subzi with a huge omelette. We literally found just omelette in the dish, there were like 4 small pieces of chicken in the dish. The quality of the restaurant got degraded. The ambience of restaurant has been pretty good. I wish they try to change their dishes and add new menu items with a well versed waiters.",

We have tried almost every pizza on the menu and loved it to it's bit. Base is fresh, toppings are fresh and love the thickness of the sauces. They serve both vegetarians and non vegetarian pizzas,  pastas, burgers and sides. \nWe love Chicken tikka pizza with cheese burst. The cheese they add just melts and flows in your mouth like that. We also had BBQ pizza it was okay okay. \nIt's a very well known place for pizza in spite surrounded by very well known pizza places.\n \nService is bit slow and they don't pay attention till you call them.

They are cordially amazing people who would rather be the hosts to enrich the ambience and hospitality of this place which would go hand in hand.\n\nThe Small and Compact sized rotis are ensuring the best for your Diet quotient that is what these people have got in store for you. \n\nThe exquisite set of Desserts and Sweetdishes include stuffs as per your concern.

Did not try the second drink. Mushroom cheese starter was ok ok types. The main course had panipuri at the start comprising of both cold water Pani Puri and hot ragda Pani Puri. The other items were phulka, naan, puri, mix veg bhaji, paneer masala, akrodh halwa(super heavy and delicious), malai cheni, veg biryani, raita, salad, papad, pickle, chana, tomato, cucumber, beet, etc. There was another sweet which looked like made from sewai. Lastly, the course summed up with roasted almond ice cream and butter milk. Overall ok and definitely could have been better.",

The mushrooms were heavenly and left us salivating for more! The chicken was spicy and a little salty due to the flavour combination of acchar but definitely succulent. \nJumping onto our absolute favourite Butter Chicken, we decided to pair it with Chilli Cheese Naan and Stuffed Chur Chur Kulcha. The gravy was creamy and sweet, great quantity with bite sized pieces of chicken which we loved! More so the naan with the perfect amount of cheese. The kulcha could be savoured all by itself with the masala stuffing. \nWe would absolutely suggest this place for a wholesome and happy meal!",

Was excited to hear that they recently opened a delivery and takeaway outlet near Vama, Kemp's Corner Flyover, Pedder Road! And finally I decided to visit this new one.\n\nFirst thought, I would do a takeaway, but there is space for about 6 to 8 people to sit and eat at the outlet. So thought might as well do that! This outlet delivers to places in the radius of 4 kms or so, which means pretty much entire of South Mumbai. Indizza serves North Indian food - Appetizers, Rolls, Curries, Dal, Rotis and Desserts! In short a wholesome meal. They have reasonable amount of Veg and Non Veg options which I believe would cater to all.\n\nTalking about what all I tried at Indizza -\n\nWe started with few starters - Bharwaan Mushroom Tikka, Paneer Jeera Mirch Tikka and Aloo Achari Tikka. I would personally recommend these starters in the same order. Mushroom Tikka is too good, lipsmacking! In case one doesn't prefer mushroom, then one should go for Paneer Jeera Mirch Tikka, there are other options as well in Paneer Tikka. Paneer was soft and all appetizers came along with Pudina mint chutney and some onions. Aloo Achari lacked the taste though.\n\nWe ordered for some drinks. Besides the regular soft drinks they serve Nimbu Pani and Pudina Nimbu Pani! Nothing fancy about it and the drinks were also served in basic bottles, but effective and refreshing taste to go along with the food!\n\nNext from the rolls section, we ordered the Paneer Makhani Roll, wrapped neatly in an aluminium silver foil. Rolls are served in tandoori or Roomali roti! We had this roll in Roomali Roti. Yummy, the filling was too good, roti cooked well. No complaints at all. Would recommend people trying rolls as per their likings and preferences.\n\nMoving to the mains, we ordered for Dal Makhani, Paneer Tikka Masala. From the Rotis, I was really excited to try the Truffle Cheese Naan. Naan was cut in a way Pizza is cut. Stuffed with regular cheese flavoured with Truffle. Truffles have garlicky flavour and a peculiar aroma. I personally loved it, some may feel it to be pungent. So please use your discretion. For me Truffle Cheese Naan was the Highlight or Star of the evening! Dal Makhani creamy - rich - thick, perfect in taste. Paneer Tikka Masala adequately spiced and rich in flavour! What an awesome meal.\n\nFinally turned to desserts, tried the Gooey Chocolate. Served in a basic container, but loved the chocolate crumbles and topping on fresh swedish chocolate cake! Divine and perfect way to end!\n\nI am happy, that I decided to have my meal there rather than takeaway. Liked the overall experience, staff was courteous, Mr. Vijay was helpful! Would recommend all, do try Indizza, definitely worth every penny that you spend!",

They have interesting combinations of pizzas such as the Popeye pizza- which has spinach, onion and feta as toppings. This is a really unique combination but it works really well together. We also ordered the Bombay pizza which had onion and capsicum. We added truffle oil to this  which made it even better! They have many options to add on to the pizza as well. My favourite was the garlic oil which we added on almost all the pizzas and it was delicious. We also got the margarita pizza which is a classic but was still really good! All the ingredients they use are high quality which makes the experience even better. We also got the garlic cheese bomb which is super cheesy and unique. It comes with a spicy capsicum dip as well and is a definite must try if you go there! Although, the food was great I feel it had become very cold and rubbery by the time it came home and it would have been way better if we ate it there. Also, the food was delivered later than the time mentioned. But this place is definitely value for money and I will be ordering again.",

It almost took 20 mins for the starters to arrive.. 😌\n\nWe tried to be on a safer side and called for *Chilli Potatoes*. The dish was really good in terms of taste.. This is the dish which actually saved the night if you could say!\n\nWe also orderd Chilli Garlic Noodles, however the noodles seemed to be dry, and didn't bring out the Garlic taste much, however it was chilly as per the name !\n\nStaff were really helpful though 🙂",

They don't have variety, what's available isn't  great plus it's expensive. Honestly, I tried to like their food (visited twice) but when they could not even get the Masala Papad right, I was convinced. Wish they'd look into this department and get it right, just like they got the ambience right. \n\nFor me, this place is great just for having a couple of drinks. Enjoy your Zomato Gold or their local offer for that day.",

Overall its good.\n\nFOOD: \n\nThe quality of food as compared to the amount we are paying is too low. Even the taste was not as good as other bar provides. They usually takes time to prepare but the wait isn't worth. \n\nBAR:\n\nThe bar has good menu options with various types of alcohols been served. The beer quality doesn't fit with your regular taste. I was not feeling like having it. So think before ordering.\n\nSHEESHA: They have herbal sheesha. Mostly it doesn't create much smoke but is good as compared to other sheeshas.\nThey have an hour limit for each pot. It was nice.\n\nPRICE:\n\nEverything is overpriced plus additional taxes are imposed. A small redbull can costed us around ₹220. All other food items were heavily charged. For no taste we paid excessively high amount. Totally dissatisfied with their pricing system. \n\nSERVICE:\n\nService was very prompt and the persons were very polite and well mannered. They obeyed properly and served professionally. 9/10 for them. \n\nOverall experience:\n\nFirst of all, the main factor is price and food. I was disappointed by both. There was no proper taste or flavour in food. Paying more for those were other issue. So, I don't recommend anyone to go here unless it's urgency for you. There are several more in area which gives best service.",

I placed the order at 10.30pm on the 23rd of August and we ate the food at 1.30am. The next day when I called 5 spice letting them know how tasteless the food was they stated that you should have called on the same  every day.when I already told him that we had the food at 1.30am. Later he tells me that you should have called before 12.00pm because the chef's were there till that time and only then this feedback/complain would have been considered. He also stated that we do not have a manager present at the moment and are working with minimum staff. I did tell him then why did you take the order when you guy's can't keep up to the mark of providing good food and service. When I told him that I will put my reviews he was all OK about it. This was the worst experience ever in terms of food and service. Will order food from small Chinese stalls hence forth.",

The next day when I called 5 spice letting them know how tasteless the food was they stated that you should have called the same day when I had already told him that we had the food at 1.30am. Later he tells me that you should have called before 12.00pm only then he would have considered because I called him at 2.00pm the next day. He also stated that we do not have a manager and we have very less staffing. I did tell him then why did you take the order. When I told him that I will put my reviews he was all OK about it.

Probably the staff noticed that too and smilingly gestured me to sit down, in seconds two of them came to clean the table, passed all the leftovers towards me, asked if I needed anything, although being part of their job, I could feel the extra warmth.\n\nSo kudos to the staff and thanks for the lovely gesture that day :)",

You can choose ingredients to make your own salad.\n\nThere is small bakery upstairs. Our kids went to see it too. \n\nThe service is quick and efficient.

Unfortunately the name escapes me! Elephant something...\nThe Sangria though was a let down! Had to set it aside! Just order simple red wine folks.\nThe starters good but did not relish the paneer much. Even in the main course it did nothing for me.\nLiked their health station and the spectacled chef behind it, courteous and helpful! Made me a great salad and batter fried broccoli and potatoes \nThe cheese counter and the dishes next to it were great esp the one with couscous! Took a double serving \nThe mushroom chestnut preparation looked scary but made up in taste! \nTheir curd rice too was good \nIt being a veg day I did not taste the fish or chicken but my friend appreciated them\nHad a great time",

The dish had plain rice on the top and a layer of chicken gravy and egg at the bottom. They also served the Raita with it. Now coming to CHICKEN KHAPSA DELUXE RICE where the quantity is same as the Chicken Kahpsa Rice. For those prefer chinese can go for this as I found it better than the Chicken khapsa Rice coz It comes with a layer of chicken tikka topped with a layer of fried rice. And then comes the CHICKEN HAKKA NOODLES where the quantity is good enough for 2 medium eating people. Not to forget that it was delicious, not too oily and they served with shezwan chutney. In second visit i had CHICKEN TIKKA BIRIYANI and in this the quantity is enough for just one person served with Raita. It was awesome and spicy as expected. Not the best Ive had, but good none the less. Along with it i had DOUBLE CHICKEN DOUBLE CHEESE PERI PERI SHAWARMA which was cheesy and spicy and served with a mayonese layer on top. Most teenagers come here only for this. These. are one of the best you can get in Navi Mumbai. And lastly the COLD COFFEE which was chilled and thick and had perfectly strong flavour also was cheap and totally worth",

May be it's tasty , may be it's not! If anyone tries that, let me know!\nChaas or the Buttermilk was looking so thick and it was surprisingly so watery.. 🙊🙊 it was a nice jeera milky water i must say!\nAmbience: premise is Nicely lit but it was hot inside. Really very hot and humid where outside weather was pleasant! So eating in hot and humid environment in a restaurant where I am paying for food and taxes as well is not my thing!\nNo washrooms in this restaurant, there is a public washroom in front of this!\nThis is right opposite to Sewree bus depot.\nCard payments were accepted.\nIn and all, if I am to go again I would definitely hesitate unless am dying of hunger!",

Chinese as well as Indian preferably North Indian cuisine, Mughlai dishes, and of course sea food too. \n\nI visited the place on Friday evening and it was all packed by 9 pm. More of a family restaurant. I saw many a families having dinner there. \n\nGenerally I prefer to have non veg food but looking at a delicious menu here, I tried all vegetarian food and it was awesome. Appetizer as well as main course were delicious. \n\nTried a few mocktails and they were worth every penny you would end up paying. \n\nPinacolada: My usual drink. When in confusion, choose pinacolada. They had it perfectly. The blend was proportionate in a perfect way. Pineapple with coconut. Vanilla ice cream. \n\nFruit punch: Mix of fruits. I requested them to make it without sugar syrup and they rightly did so. Refreshing. Fresh fruits. One of the best fruit punch preparations, I had in recent time. A bit tangy. \n\nThe staff is very cooperative and helped me in deciding my orders. \n\nTandoor broccoli and paneer: Generally, these two are different dishes: tandoor paneer and tandoor broccoli. I requested them to have it combined and they obliged it happily. Served with green chutney and red sauce. Perfectly grilled veggies. Delicious. Luscious paneer. Broccoli too was delicious. Paneer topped with cheese and coriander. Broccoli also topped with coriander. Onion slaw topped with mint and lemon. Broccoli had mustard feel as it was marinated with mustard sauce. Paneer was grilled along with onion, capsicum, and pineapple. \n\nHara bhara kebab with galouti kebab: Melting kebabs. Galouti kebabs were better than hara bhara kebab but again this is sin comparing two food dishes, isn't it? Loved both the kebabs. Served with tomato sauce. Galouti kebab were made from beetroot. Filled with cheese and cream. \n\nIn main course, we had tawa mushroom along with chura paratha. \n\nTawa mushroom was cooked properly. Fresh mushroom. Gravy was perfectly fine. Goes well with chura paratha. Mushroom gravy had capsicum, bell peppers. Topped with coriander. Red gravy. Delicious. Paratha was something unique, it was more like warqi paratha. \n\nIn dessert, we had gulab jamun rabdi. Delicious rabdi topped with gulab jamun. Perfectly sweetened rabdi. Loved the dessert too. Chilled rabdi served with hot gulab jamun. Topped with dry fruits. \n\nOverall, this is a nice place. The food is good. They have given emphasis on hygiene also. Cleanliness was upto the mark.",

Place is very famous and very small as well, I waited for almost 30min outside in queue and 15 min to get my order and offered seats on sharing basis, no customer service ! Make sure  you have enough free time as there you may face a long queue and waiting time . The service may seem a little bit slow Just because of the crowd but the quality of the food is graet . No  Ac . Tables are very congested can't even sit and eat with comfortable posture, but taste is wow ! Sardar is very old outlet dating back to 1966 and known for its delicious buttery pav bhaji. They have maintained the same taste since then and the outlet seems to be always crowded with people and on weekends you have to wait for a hour or so to get seats. Must recommend for someone who wants to try out one of the best Pav bhaji !! Good by taste with loads of butter. It is having good service but too much of waiting specially during weekends as process is one round for parcel and one for having it there. It also serve milkshakes but it's costlier than it should be . Limited parking place .\n       Overall had an amazing experience over there and would love to visit this place again.",

Must recommend place for the vegetarians if you are near to vashi, Navi Mumbai. The staffs are very helpful and they try to make your visit memorable. Ambience of the restaurant is normal. In vashi branch they have two floors, while ground floor is non AC and upper floor is fully air-conditioned and the price different for both the floor.",

You have a decent variety of craft beers to choose from. The apple cider is one of the popular choices. Not only are the beers good but the snacks are equally good too. The potato fries are served with a variety of dips which is a must try. And to add to it you have various board games to choose from to enjoy with friends. The entire ambiance and the food adds to the experience. Really good place to visit with a group of friends.",

I was on the fence as to whether I should visit Gujurat, but if they cook like the chefs at Nimantran, I'm definitely going to go.  The menu is simple, there's a thali, but there's such variety with sweet, savory and spicy.  And it's a subtle spiciness so if you're a white person like me, don't be turned away.  Its 325 rupees for an all you can eat thali at dinner time, and the owner and staff were really welcoming and friendly guys.  I arrived at 7 on the dot so I had some time alone to talk with them and they answered any questions I had about any of the new exotic dishes.",

And many times the DJ was doing over remixes because of which the joyness of original song got destroyed . Otherwise the club is very spacious and awesome but a little expensive . Unfortunately They don't serve breezer and vodka . I am little disappointed by the availability of food \nMumbai's standards. Double ceiling roof, well lit and great music system.\nOf course it will come with a price, drinks are costly and so is a table if you don't fancy the idea of dancing for long or want to take a pause.\nWhole place is divided in half, the other half is seems a private place. On a Saturday night People start coming around 11 and its good number of people who visit.\nTrendy, late-night club offering cocktails & global fare, plus lively DJs, dancing & VIP \n1.Entry fees is 3000 rupees.\n2. Once you go inside you can not go out and re enter.\n3. There is no single chair to sit.\n4. Drinks costs avarage 1000 rupees plus service charge 10% plus VAT plus 2xGST. Photo of a bill is shared.\n5. The music is trance and very loud. Neither you can dance on it nor you can talk to your friends/Partner\n6. I could see barely 18 year old teens inside the club which made me uncomfortable.\n7. Club is divided into two. To enter the half where crowd is less and has seating arrangement, you have to pay hefty.\n8. If you want to sit at crowded area, you have to pay a big amount to book a chair.\nSuperb music superb vibes electric atmosphere on weekends that continues till 4 am in the morning. Visited this pub on a Saturday night. Entry was 3000 (Cover Charge) for couple, Food and drinks were fine, service was a bit slow but when you are in such an electric atmosphere dont realy care, Overall a 3/5 for food n service but a 5+ for the you atmosphere.",
