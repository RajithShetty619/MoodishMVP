Very attractive moktail for pictures clicking. Balance sweetness & was perfectly prepared.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£-Next i tried garlic bread there were 4 pieces in a plate and garlic bread was too tasty n soft the size of the bread was quiet large but they don provide u any sauses or chutney with it. As the taste is little different so you can enjoy without chutney or any sauces\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£:-Then i tried chiken platter it was very very mouth watering cheese üßÄ was topped over it  platter was garnished with some carrot and cabbage also a bowl of green chutney the chiken was very soft and marinated with garlic üßÑ ginger paste along with some spices in it we luved it i would like to rate 10 out 10 to this chiken platter\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£- And the last i ordered chicken crispy tempting ü§©ü§ë and this chicken crispy was garnished with coriander . I like the taste was not so spicy u can have it some szhewan sause as per your taste or its a good option to start your dinner ü•ò\n\n‚û°Ô∏èAmbience-  It's  an Indo-western fusion restaurant and bar.They have an outside seating as well as well-decorated dim indoor ambience with full of load music with attracts so much.\none of those places which has a really quirky ambience and a unique way of serving food.\n\nAmbience-5/5\nService-5/5\nTaste-5/5\nworth for money-5/5",

Mojo does not provide a bag anyways. And the choco lava cake he brought had spilled as it was lying clumsily at the bottom with onions and veggies on top of it. \n\nI make it a point to wash all the veggies received as they are all touched by hand. Do u expect me to wash the choco lava cake? \nThis executive argued that he sanitized his hands at the store. But what about him touching the bike handle and ten other things on the way? \n\nI want an immediate call back and replacement. \nI am going to share this second horrible experience online on all possible channels (Twitter Facebook and wherever else possible). \n\nEnough is enough.",

In all the cocktails, the alcohol taste was subtle while the punch was still there.\nFood wise the fare is ordinary to good, the cheese filled pakodas were good while the salad was barely passable, being too sweet.\n\nThe dessert was sinful and amazing to eat.

They come up with these seasonal menus which is excellent.\n\nTried a couple of dishes here from the summer and the new menu. Loved a few.\n\nDo try the Sichuan Sliders. They were delicious. Crisp patty, spicy sauce.. one lipsmacking slider. The noodle bhel salad accompanied was to die for.\n\nThe potato wedges were crisp and delicious. Loved the seasoning.\n\nCrispy cracker mousse from the summer menu.. creamy smooth Mushroom mousse and spicy guacamole topped over a crisp cracker. It was quite good. A balance of textures..  creamy, spicy, crispy and smooth.\n\nPower protein salad from the summer menu.. this salad was delicious. Loved it. Chickpeas, Arugula, almonds, edamame and quinoa with a super delicious dressing.\n\nRed and black combo from summer menu.. Manipur edamame black rice served with a coconut based chickpeas and Vegetable curry. This dish was delicious and healthy.\n\nSweet curd with mango .. from the summer menu.. a delicious yougurt with mango sorbet..I quite liked this one.\n\nChocolate Churros... Oh so good. Loved them. Do try!\nBig fat churros drizzled with dark, milk and white chocolate and served with more Chocolate sauce.\n\nPaneer Makhani sizzler... This one was decent..but my least favourite since I'm not a Makhani fan. The pulav was delicious. The paneer was melt in the mouth soft.. the gravy was a little sweet for my liking.\n\nCottage cheese rolls with Crunchy oats... These could have been better. The cottage cheese and the sauce within was delicious but the outer skin can be worked on.\n\nKashmiri kawah/twings and berries.. both the teas were good.\n\nOverall a good experience.",

The mushrooms were heavenly and left us salivating for more! The chicken was spicy and a little salty due to the flavour combination of acchar but definitely succulent. \nJumping onto our absolute favourite Butter Chicken, we decided to pair it with Chilli Cheese Naan and Stuffed Chur Chur Kulcha. The gravy was creamy and sweet, great quantity with bite sized pieces of chicken which we loved! More so the naan with the perfect amount of cheese. The kulcha could be savoured all by itself with the masala stuffing. \nWe would absolutely suggest this place for a wholesome and happy meal!",

Was excited to hear that they recently opened a delivery and takeaway outlet near Vama, Kemp's Corner Flyover, Pedder Road! And finally I decided to visit this new one.\n\nFirst thought, I would do a takeaway, but there is space for about 6 to 8 people to sit and eat at the outlet. So thought might as well do that! This outlet delivers to places in the radius of 4 kms or so, which means pretty much entire of South Mumbai. Indizza serves North Indian food - Appetizers, Rolls, Curries, Dal, Rotis and Desserts! In short a wholesome meal. They have reasonable amount of Veg and Non Veg options which I believe would cater to all.\n\nTalking about what all I tried at Indizza -\n\nWe started with few starters - Bharwaan Mushroom Tikka, Paneer Jeera Mirch Tikka and Aloo Achari Tikka. I would personally recommend these starters in the same order. Mushroom Tikka is too good, lipsmacking! In case one doesn't prefer mushroom, then one should go for Paneer Jeera Mirch Tikka, there are other options as well in Paneer Tikka. Paneer was soft and all appetizers came along with Pudina mint chutney and some onions. Aloo Achari lacked the taste though.\n\nWe ordered for some drinks. Besides the regular soft drinks they serve Nimbu Pani and Pudina Nimbu Pani! Nothing fancy about it and the drinks were also served in basic bottles, but effective and refreshing taste to go along with the food!\n\nNext from the rolls section, we ordered the Paneer Makhani Roll, wrapped neatly in an aluminium silver foil. Rolls are served in tandoori or Roomali roti! We had this roll in Roomali Roti. Yummy, the filling was too good, roti cooked well. No complaints at all. Would recommend people trying rolls as per their likings and preferences.\n\nMoving to the mains, we ordered for Dal Makhani, Paneer Tikka Masala. From the Rotis, I was really excited to try the Truffle Cheese Naan. Naan was cut in a way Pizza is cut. Stuffed with regular cheese flavoured with Truffle. Truffles have garlicky flavour and a peculiar aroma. I personally loved it, some may feel it to be pungent. So please use your discretion. For me Truffle Cheese Naan was the Highlight or Star of the evening! Dal Makhani creamy - rich - thick, perfect in taste. Paneer Tikka Masala adequately spiced and rich in flavour! What an awesome meal.\n\nFinally turned to desserts, tried the Gooey Chocolate. Served in a basic container, but loved the chocolate crumbles and topping on fresh swedish chocolate cake! Divine and perfect way to end!\n\nI am happy, that I decided to have my meal there rather than takeaway. Liked the overall experience, staff was courteous, Mr. Vijay was helpful! Would recommend all, do try Indizza, definitely worth every penny that you spend!",

This place has an awesome vibe, cozy ambience, super tasty food & fantastic music.\n\nWe tried -\n\nPeri Peri Prawns Skewers\nFish & Chips\nJamaican Jerk Chicken\nRice & Mutton Chilly\nRaasta Special Desert\n\nThe food was super tasty.. Awesome in flavour & decent in quantity.\nThe fish & chips was the bestest out of all.\n\nThe Raasta Special Desert is a must try. It's basically their signature chocolate cake which looks too good & tastes simply awesome.\n\nWith lovely food there is a need for lovely drink, we tried 2 cocktails & mocktail.\n\nWe had an awesome time at Raasta & we highly recommend this place.\n\nGo Go Go üòç",

Talking about the presentation actually I am speechless bcoz I have never seen this perfection.\nThe service given was equivalent to a 5 start hotel service. The waiters were claim and ready to help and it was quite good to have dine there. The prices were also pocket friendly. Talking about the quantity and quality it is worth the price.

I've been a frequent visitor here and I've had one hell of a night every single time I've visited this place. They've come up with this new beautiful entrance which is decorated with golden fairy lights. They have a huge green wall opposite the entrance as its selfie point. Yeda Republic is an evil styled lounge bar with space suits and dark alleys. The lounge bar is located underground in the basement with Carribean flags with life like props wearing space suits, gas masks and respiratory pipes while you walk your way down. They have huge a jeep like structure located right in the centre where cute little staff members dressed up in spacesuits dance during weekends. Dark zones, Gas chambers, Ceiling with human bodies strapped with masks, ropes, jute bags, tunnel-like entry to the restrooms, waiters dressed like prisoners in orange one-piece suits are some of the traits of this lounge. The bar counter is clearly the highlight of this place with large cylindrical pipes which drop down from the ceiling and houses the Bar Bottles, for the rest of the display. They also have a fancy telephone booth with 5 ancient telephones. Talking about the food, the menu is a little compact when it comes to food. One thing they could work on is their menu. They have a wide bar menu but only 4 mocktails and 3 desserts in all. Also, I'd recommend y'all to place your order for maincourse and desserts along with the appetizers itself as they take a while to prepare the food.\n\nWe'd ordered :\nIn Mocktails :\n1. Fruitshoot - Mixed fruits blended with sugar and vanilla ice-cream. The taste was good. If you like your drink sweet, you can opt for this one.\n\n2. Lipstick - This is a tiny glass of mocktail having a very attractive red colour consisting of orange, mint, cranberry juice and peach crush.\n\nIn Cocktails :\n1. Bloody Mary - This is our all time favorite, red colored spicy cocktail which will surely get you in the mood.\n\nIn Appetizers :\n1. Cheese Corn Nuggets - Seven pieces of nuggets having melted cheese, corn and capsicum in its filling served with a dip. They are medium spicy in taste. \n\n2. Chicken Lollipop - Six pieces of chicken legs served with green chutney. They have a tangy taste. \n\nIn Mains :\n1. Chicken Sphaghetti Pasta with Pesto Sauce - They have three options in pasta base, ie. Sphaghetti, Macaroni and Penne Pasta. We'd opted for Sphaghetti Pasta in Pesto Sauce with chicken as its add on. It's served with two long garlic breads, garnished with cheese and black olives.\n\n2. Chicken Makhani Pizza - This is a thin crust pizza which has Makhani sauce in its base topped with chicken pieces and cheese.\n\nIn Dessert :\n1. Paan Falooda - I'm a huge paan lover so went for this one. This a satiating glass of falooda with paan syrup, jelly, almonds, cashews and french vanilla ice-cream.",

All of them were flatteringly amazing . Everytime you be here there is an equally flabbergasting and ambient gesture you get as you are being treated as a humble guest at their best. They are cordially amazing people who would rather be the hosts to enrich the ambience and hospitality of this place which would go hand in hand.\n\nThe Small and Compact sized rotis are ensuring the best for your Diet quotient that is what these people have got in store for you. \n\nThe exquisite set of Desserts and Sweetdishes include stuffs as per your concern. From pan shots, Mastanis to what not . Every nook and corner of countryland cuisine is taken into consideration here.\n\nI appreciate the decorum and decors which go here hand in hand with that pitch of demanding excellence of plush interiors .\n\nWould love To be here again sooner !! \n\nKudos to The Team Grand Thali, Tip Top plaza .",

The catering was decent not extra ordinary as such. The evening reception had one type of mushroom starter with kokam and one more welcome drink. Kokam hardly had the kokam flavor in it. Did not try the second drink. Mushroom cheese starter was ok ok types. The main course had panipuri at the start comprising of both cold water Pani Puri and hot ragda Pani Puri. The other items were phulka, naan, puri, mix veg bhaji, paneer masala, akrodh halwa(super heavy and delicious), malai cheni, veg biryani, raita, salad, papad, pickle, chana, tomato, cucumber, beet, etc. There was another sweet which looked like made from sewai. Lastly, the course summed up with roasted almond ice cream and butter milk. Overall ok and definitely could have been better.",

Chinese as well as Indian preferably North Indian cuisine, Mughlai dishes, and of course sea food too. \n\nI visited the place on Friday evening and it was all packed by 9 pm. More of a family restaurant. I saw many a families having dinner there. \n\nGenerally I prefer to have non veg food but looking at a delicious menu here, I tried all vegetarian food and it was awesome. Appetizer as well as main course were delicious. \n\nTried a few mocktails and they were worth every penny you would end up paying. \n\nPinacolada: My usual drink. When in confusion, choose pinacolada. They had it perfectly. The blend was proportionate in a perfect way. Pineapple with coconut. Vanilla ice cream. \n\nFruit punch: Mix of fruits. I requested them to make it without sugar syrup and they rightly did so. Refreshing. Fresh fruits. One of the best fruit punch preparations, I had in recent time. A bit tangy. \n\nThe staff is very cooperative and helped me in deciding my orders. \n\nTandoor broccoli and paneer: Generally, these two are different dishes: tandoor paneer and tandoor broccoli. I requested them to have it combined and they obliged it happily. Served with green chutney and red sauce. Perfectly grilled veggies. Delicious. Luscious paneer. Broccoli too was delicious. Paneer topped with cheese and coriander. Broccoli also topped with coriander. Onion slaw topped with mint and lemon. Broccoli had mustard feel as it was marinated with mustard sauce. Paneer was grilled along with onion, capsicum, and pineapple. \n\nHara bhara kebab with galouti kebab: Melting kebabs. Galouti kebabs were better than hara bhara kebab but again this is sin comparing two food dishes, isn't it? Loved both the kebabs. Served with tomato sauce. Galouti kebab were made from beetroot. Filled with cheese and cream. \n\nIn main course, we had tawa mushroom along with chura paratha. \n\nTawa mushroom was cooked properly. Fresh mushroom. Gravy was perfectly fine. Goes well with chura paratha. Mushroom gravy had capsicum, bell peppers. Topped with coriander. Red gravy. Delicious. Paratha was something unique, it was more like warqi paratha. \n\nIn dessert, we had gulab jamun rabdi. Delicious rabdi topped with gulab jamun. Perfectly sweetened rabdi. Loved the dessert too. Chilled rabdi served with hot gulab jamun. Topped with dry fruits. \n\nOverall, this is a nice place. The food is good. They have given emphasis on hygiene also. Cleanliness was upto the mark.",

The dish had plain rice on the top and a layer of chicken gravy and egg at the bottom. They also served the Raita with it. Now coming to CHICKEN KHAPSA DELUXE RICE where the quantity is same as the Chicken Kahpsa Rice. For those prefer chinese can go for this as I found it better than the Chicken khapsa Rice coz It comes with a layer of chicken tikka topped with a layer of fried rice. And then comes the CHICKEN HAKKA NOODLES where the quantity is good enough for 2 medium eating people. Not to forget that it was delicious, not too oily and they served with shezwan chutney. In second visit i had CHICKEN TIKKA BIRIYANI and in this the quantity is enough for just one person served with Raita. It was awesome and spicy as expected. Not the best Ive had, but good none the less. Along with it i had DOUBLE CHICKEN DOUBLE CHEESE PERI PERI SHAWARMA which was cheesy and spicy and served with a mayonese layer on top. Most teenagers come here only for this. These. are one of the best you can get in Navi Mumbai. And lastly the COLD COFFEE which was chilled and thick and had perfectly strong flavour also was cheap and totally worth",

Overall its good.\n\nFOOD: \n\nThe quality of food as compared to the amount we are paying is too low. Even the taste was not as good as other bar provides. They usually takes time to prepare but the wait isn't worth. \n\nBAR:\n\nThe bar has good menu options with various types of alcohols been served. The beer quality doesn't fit with your regular taste. I was not feeling like having it. So think before ordering.\n\nSHEESHA: They have herbal sheesha. Mostly it doesn't create much smoke but is good as compared to other sheeshas.\nThey have an hour limit for each pot. It was nice.\n\nPRICE:\n\nEverything is overpriced plus additional taxes are imposed. A small redbull can costed us around ‚Çπ220. All other food items were heavily charged. For no taste we paid excessively high amount. Totally dissatisfied with their pricing system. \n\nSERVICE:\n\nService was very prompt and the persons were very polite and well mannered. They obeyed properly and served professionally. 9/10 for them. \n\nOverall experience:\n\nFirst of all, the main factor is price and food. I was disappointed by both. There was no proper taste or flavour in food. Paying more for those were other issue. So, I don't recommend anyone to go here unless it's urgency for you. There are several more in area which gives best service.",

It can go up till an hour. And you have to share a table with strangers which might kind of invade your privacy. Rest everything is amazing. It's a good place to visit for having a light dinner.

Must recommend place for the vegetarians if you are near to vashi, Navi Mumbai. The staffs are very helpful and they try to make your visit memorable. Ambience of the restaurant is normal.

I'll breakdown my review in few pointers\n\nLocation: Pretty far from Vasai railway station. This is a good hotel for the locals who live nearby\n\nAmbience: Great with good ventilation and seats. The restaurant also offers a music area where music is played in the evening. It also has bar area\n\nFood: The food quality is good and tastes well. I have tried some of the things in the menu and it has not really disappointed me\n\nPrice: Fairly priced the food can come upto 1000 approx for two people. With drinks it would be extra\n\nParking: There is a big parking space available downstairs for both two and four wheelers\n\nOverall review: Good for a weekend dinner. You can make reservations or walk in too. For certain occasions or festival do make reservations. The hotel is big enough to accommodate quite number of people. The staff is good and the hotel offers great value for money",

The Murg Mussalam , butter chicken, noodles, fruit punch and other bunch of starters are perfect. But after the renovation I visited the place and I asked them what‚Äôs new food items. He said the same old dishes and when I asked what‚Äôs new other than tht, then he did not have any clue. I asked for a new kebab type starter for which he suggested chicken ghee roast. It was not good, there was no taste of ghee nor was it roasted, you can see in the picture that it wasn‚Äôt served like a kebab but like a main course side dish. Taste wasn‚Äôt upto the mark. I also ordered a fruit punch to set my mood, which was classic, tasty! But nothing new in the drink menu. For main course I ordered Chicken Patiyala, and I have to say that it was the most uninteresting looking dish I have had. Chicken patiyala consists of a base of chicken stuffed omelette which is topped with a great tasting gravy. But here at neel Kamal, it was just a plain chicken curry and they topped the whole subzi with a huge omelette. We literally found just omelette in the dish, there were like 4 small pieces of chicken in the dish. The quality of the restaurant got degraded. The ambience of restaurant has been pretty good. I wish they try to change their dishes and add new menu items with a well versed waiters.",

You just can't stop after one bite!.. It's all time regular favourites for most of the tables!. Surely try this dish for starters!.\n\nWe next ordered Chinese Platter, it was finger licking & platter had sufficient quantity for sharing wise!. Several Chinese items include manchurian balls, Vej crispy, paneer chilli & spring rolls & salad in sidings!.\n\nWe also had Paneer Tikka Dry, it was mouthwatering to glance & craving for more!. The spices were nicely blend & paneer was coated crisply & lip smacking!.\n\nPaneer Cheese Tikka, is a nice fusion of seasoned paneer & over loaded cheese!. If you love both, surely go for this tikka, it's finger licking awesome!.\n\nBhagat Tarachand Special Thali  gives a glimpse of its succesful tradition it carries!. Balanced so well with ghee chapatis, 2 sabji of own choice, papad, dal, raita etc!. It's wholesome & flavourful by all means!.\n\nGulab Jamun is tender soft & sweet to its core, lingering sweetness for a long time to cherish!. Surely good to try Gulab Jamuns for dessert!.\n\nIcecream slice looked tempting & every slice of it was yummm!! After heavy dining, it's truly a bliss to pounce on desserts like this for sweet tooth lovers!.\n\nB Bhagat Tarachand is a proven excellence & you surely visit this place quite often to experience it's awesome treat & hospitality!.

It‚Äôs one thing to raise prices, but to make portions so small that they don‚Äôt even satisfy one person is really ridiculous! The pizzas are the only saving grace. Alcohol prices are also absurdly high. One can‚Äôt even enjoy a decent glass wine below Rs.1000 per glass. The management seems to have the misconception that they are some Michelin star fine dine restaurant! They need to come back to earth or people will stop patronising soon. \nThe earlier decor was bright and cheerful but now it‚Äôs become really dark and dingy, more like a lounge bar.

This rice also includes 3-4 boiled eggs along with some salad which includes carrot, onion and tomato. Instead of serving it in a plate or a medium sized utensil, they prefer to serve it in a big thali which gives you the feel of eating like a nawab or a Mughal. The kepsa rice is served in two proportions half and the other one is the full. Half kepsa is ample enough for serving 2-3 people while full on the other hand can easily serve 5 people.  They do have 2 sections ac and non ac. Ac section is located besides the restaurant and goes under the name of Mao Chinese centre.  Talking about the hygiene part, it is below average, so just in case if you‚Äôre looking for an hygienic place this is not the right place to be. Instead you can opt for takeaway option which is must better than eating at that particular restaurant. They do serve different types of deserts as well of which caramel custard is the best out of all the deserts served over here.",

I'll breakdown my review in few pointers\n\nLocation: Pretty far from Vasai railway station. This is a good hotel for the locals who live nearby\n\nAmbience: Great with good ventilation and seats. The restaurant also offers a music area where music is played in the evening. It also has bar area\n\nFood: The food quality is good and tastes well. I have tried some of the things in the menu and it has not really disappointed me\n\nPrice: Fairly priced the food can come upto 1000 approx for two people. With drinks it would be extra\n\nParking: There is a big parking space available downstairs for both two and four wheelers\n\nOverall review: Good for a weekend dinner. You can make reservations or walk in too. For certain occasions or festival do make reservations. The hotel is big enough to accommodate quite number of people. The staff is good and the hotel offers great value for money",

Even being a small cafe, ambience is good and well maintained. Staff is so helpful and suggests very well. \nWe had -\nCindrella - Basically a pure Kiwi juice which I never tried before. Too good. Recommended.\n.\nPan shots - 6 small shots of mint, lemon with soda. So refreshing. Something new. Highly recommended.\n.\nMangolian Pasta - Creamy pasta with some vegies. Tasted good.\n.\nMelting Grill Sandwich - This one is a must try. Filled with loads of cheese and mayo, loved it. Highly recommended.\n.\nMexican fries - French fries with cheese, tomato sauce, chili flakes and pepper was a different combination for me. Heavy one and good in taste.\n.\nMix fruit cream - The delightful creamy end to our super amazing meal. Fruit pieces like apple, pineapple, pomegranate were served with cream. Yummy. Highly recommended.\n.\nI was satisfied with all the dishes and will definitely visit again.",

We could have not explored other things. He shud have suggested as per 3 people dining. \n\nAlso i told over the phone that i need cozy place as its someones birthday but when i went they gave me place which was in front of main door. Finally we have to changed the place and informed tjem what was requested over the phone. Lack of co-ordination on a week day. \n\nWill defintely return bcz of food and ambience.",
