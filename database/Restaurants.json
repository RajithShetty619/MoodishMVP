Must try.\n.\nNext ordered pasta garlic cheese - this is not for people who love cheesy white pasta. As it has many vegetables and it is not very cheesy. It is healthy pasta. Whole wheat penne pasta with broccoli, jalapeno, zucchini, olives etc. The pasta is accompanied by lavash crackers. Loved this too. Crispy cracker with white pasta :) :D\n.\nThere are many seasonal juices too. They have even mentioned the benefits of the fruits used in the juice. Loved the concept of healthy food.

Fresspesso gives this kind of space for the first time in town (if I am not wrong). The staff is sweet. Rates are cheap-one of the cheapest in town as well as in comparison cafes overall! Therefore don't expect too much from food items.",

Desserts very absolutely fantastic and delicious too. Carrot cake with orange is a must try. Also dark chocolate with nuts was very nice. Icecream was good.

Talking about the presentation actually I am speechless bcoz I have never seen this perfection.\nThe service given was equivalent to a 5 start hotel service. The waiters were claim and ready to help and it was quite good to have dine there. The prices were also pocket friendly. Talking about the quantity and quality it is worth the price. I wonder how difficult it must be for them to be consistent, but the fact is that they are consistent when it comes to taste.",

This rice also includes 3-4 boiled eggs along with some salad which includes carrot, onion and tomato. Instead of serving it in a plate or a medium sized utensil, they prefer to serve it in a big thali which gives you the feel of eating like a nawab or a Mughal. The kepsa rice is served in two proportions half and the other one is the full. Half kepsa is ample enough for serving 2-3 people while full on the other hand can easily serve 5 people.  They do have 2 sections ac and non ac. Ac section is located besides the restaurant and goes under the name of Mao Chinese centre.  Talking about the hygiene part, it is below average, so just in case if you’re looking for an hygienic place this is not the right place to be. Instead you can opt for takeaway option which is must better than eating at that particular restaurant. They do serve different types of deserts as well of which caramel custard is the best out of all the deserts served over here.",

There is a small stage that is there and a DJ section to the left after entering near the bar. There are limited toilets so when it’s a larger crowd this is something to be mindful about. There are many interesting design elements that make up the space. Some brilliant wall decor and lighting. \n\nFood: (4/5)\nThe buffet menu was extremely good. I was especially surprised by the quality of the fried rice. It had a really great flavour and just get light. The other dishes were also great, but nothing compared to the friend rice. The cake for dessert was also quite good, not too sweet, but still rich in flavour. \n\nSummary: (4/5)\nGood place in Belapur to drop by with friends or office colleagues. It’s not too expensive and hence make for a good even especially if there is drinking involved. Do drop by and enjoy a good evening here.",

When we complained, the answer we get is that other customers have not complained. Most of the bread and other products are old as well (i was planing to buy and checked the dates). Take your own risk when you order food from here. They don't follow any social distancing and neither check customers for temp.  For your own safety and health, avoid the place. The lady sitting in the counter is most rude one I have ever met in this business. Huge health hazard. Kitchen is very dirty if you get a chance to peen from the next door or from cash counter.",

The we have ordered both veg and non veg dishes. My best dishes was the chicken lagasne. We enjoy here a lot. Price is little bit high but you will get both quality and quantity. Recommended to everyone thank you. ❤️",

The green chutney they serve along with the Parathas is just too fabulous for the tongue. The place has line of healthy fruit juices and milkshakes at to appetize your thirst. In short it is a world of good at reasonably low prices. The only thing I would suggest is them to add Litti Chokha to their menu because I love it very very much.",

One of the wall that is covered with plates and bowls, looks impressive.\n\nBeing a weekday, the footfall was moderate, so fortunately we received a wonderful hospitality. They have ample staff to handle big numbers on any given day. For food we totally relied on our table captain. Right from the juices till the desserts, we loved almost everything we had.\n\nLets come to food now:\nOff the mark, we started with juices. Ordered for Cocktail, Orange and Watermelon. All these were amazingly refreshing, but I would recommend Cocktail juice if one would like to have tangy and sweet taste. Also tried Sweet Lassi and Kesar Lassi, Sweet Lassi was yum and thick.\n\nNext we headed to their soup section,\nWe ordered for Palak soup, Sweet corn soup and Manchow soup. Here, according to me, sweet corn and Manchow soup was nothing different from what we usually have at different places, but if you are a spinach lover, then definitely try creamy spinach soup.\n\nComing to the starters:\nHere comes Paneer Koliwada, Spicy chilly Manchurian dry, Corn Palak Kebab, Mushroom Tikka and hara bhara kebab.\nSpicy Chilly manchurian tasted well, the presentation was good, it was served in a wheat basket.\nMushroom Tikka was well marinated, very juicy from inside and delicious(Recommended)\nBut the spotlight was on Paneer Koliwada, everyone loved it that we asked for one more serving.(Recommended)\n\nFor the main course we ordered for Veg Maratha, Paneer Khurchan, Dal Makhani and Dal Tadka.\nDal Makhani was amazing. Paneer Khurchan was fine but Veg Maratha is a definite show stopper, perfectly spiced, flavourful and aromatic, loved it.\n\nFor the desserts we ordered for Rabdi with Gulab Jamun and Chef Special Dessert of the day.\nChef special was really special. This dessert was served in a fruit salad bowl, it had yummy brownie crushed along with dry fruits and fruits.( Recommended).\n\nOverall the experience at this place was good considering that I am a hardcore Non-veg lover.\nThe menu is set Moderately priced. Will visit again for sure!!!!!!!!!",

When looking at it from the outside, it looks like the perfect fine dining place with just the right amount of elegance. However, once you step inside, it is more casual and less business like. I was here with a group of friends and we had quite a few things here.\n\nWe started off with the Avocado Toastie which was crispy and delicious. A base of toast with guacamole is essentially what it was. It was bite sized and tasted pretty good but it wasn't extraordinary. It was not something that you would get a craving for, in the middle of the night.\n\nThe Botanical Bloom Bread was a delight. A huge loaf of bread was buttered up and stuffed with molten cheese and a flavor of garlic. It was crispy and the cheese sauce was just amazing. Bread and cheese is something that one can't really go wrong with and it was perfect here.\n\nWe even tried the Crispy Lotus Stem. It was slightly sweet and sticky. However, it tasted okay. The stem became chewy very quickly and it wasn't at par with the ones that I have had but it was a good effort.\n\nWe went for the Veg Exotica Pizza. It was loaded with veggies as the description stated and it was crispy, spicy and delicious. The toppings were good and it was well balanced with the amount of cheese. When it comes to pizza, the proportion matters and the proportion for this one was completely right.\n\nLastly, we tried the Avocado, Asparagus and Cream Cheese sushi. It was put together well and rolled up in white sticky rice with a slightly crisp centre of the avocado and asparagus. It was served with soya sauce and wasabi. The taste was almost perfect but it needed a bit more binding when it comes to flavor.\n\nThe place is decent and worth a shot if you like the way it looks. They have some unique dishes on their menu which are really good. They could work a bit more on enhancing their flavors and it could surely be on my list of the places to visit!\n\nAmbience: 4/5\nFood: 4/5\nService: 4/5",

I visited botanica with a group of girl friends and suffice to say that we couldn't be happier. \nBrand new, Botanica is so ideally located near Girgaum Chowpatty. It offers no booze and no meat. That is where the beauty starts.\nThey have an extensive menu. Indian, asian, continental and even fusion.\nAll mocktails and drinks are made with natural ingredients. Blue Pea, rosemary,thyme ,jalapenos, black tea, mint, chopped fruits ,you name it and they have a great drink.\nserved in pretty glasses, the drinks all taste good. Since we were so many, we could order different drinks and taste almost everything on the menu.\nWe tried Mexican Tomato soup, Miso and Green Latte. My miso soup had shitake . Well made and light.\nThe Asian delight was glass noodles in a mason jar. The wow factor was the smoke. And the smoke was in the cold salad. Each element....even the sesame seeds was so well flavoured. try the Mushrooms and mango or watermelon and feta salad if youre not keen on keeping it fresh and simple.\nZucchini cheese rolls were nice.\nThe assorted savoury cakes were a take on the kothambir wadi...with broccoli, yam etc. SO well made and the fried garlic crumbs made it even better.\nThe icing on the cake was the Rajma Galouti. So well smoked and so well smoked. For a second, I almost thought it was keema.\nSo worth the calories. you Must try this.\nWe had a dumpling platter. The drama and the plating....full marks to the chef. I liked the mushroom dumpling the best.\nThe greek pizza was super. Thin, crisp semolina base, cheese and arugula. Adult taste and awesome.\nThe chilli bbq jack fruit and asian spiced paneer baos were nice. Im not too fond of baos, so I didnt have more than a bite.\nThe sushi burger was super jazzy to look at. And on point for the sushi rice. But the paneer could be substituted with a crunch factor. That paneer made it mushy for me.\nThe jack fruit biryani was fragrant and nice.\nAs was the makhani ravioli. Pretty ,pretty and super yum, and bang on sauce.\nThe pumpkin tortellini with foam was  nice.\nDessert... theer was a chocolate with lemon grass pudding. I didnt get any lemon grass taste , but because I was full already, I didnt really miss the dessert. The basundi with rose balls...basundi with rooh afza caviar was nice.\n\nA lot of chatting, good food and good times. And we took loads of pictures that I had to share. Go here and try all the chefs and servers recommend. They know their food\n\nGo to botanica for a good time with family and friends.",

The Botanica is located in cherni road, and its 10 minutes walking from the cherni road railway station. The place can be easily located on Google map as well.\n\nThe has really nice and cosy Ambiance with really cute sitting arrangement. The round tables, sofas and amazing dining experience. They also have different country clock displayed just to have a feel of international cuisines. The ambiance is really calm. The best part about the Botanica is their hospitality and lip smacking food. They have sitting capacity of around 80-100 people. The food can be at your table within 5 to 6 minutes after ordering.\n\nThe classy Ambiance and delicious food with super friendly and humble staff makes this place perfect for a meal with a family and friends. In the menu, around 90% of the dishes can be made jain.\n\nWe tried,\nMocktails: their range of Mocktails are really refreshing and amazing. As per their recommendation we tried Botanical martini, Miss mary. And bang on both were really amazing. The taste of jalapeño in martini was coming out well, the smoky flavor was good in miss mary. Overall both were really refreshing. \n\nMexican tomato soup: A perfect start of a meal was a soup. All the flavors were coming out really nicely. The spicy, the tangy, little sweet. A perfect which can increase your craving. The soup had nachos and beans. A must try soup. \n\nCorn cottage cheese seekh: the kabab was perfectly cooked. The smokey flavors along with the flavor of corn and lots of cheese. The kabab was served along with cabbage and bell pepper salad and mint chutney. This was not that spicy. But was really soft. \n\nAsian spiced cottage cheese: again a perfect apittizer.. The rich red gravy of cashew and tomatoes along with small dices of cottage cheese and bell pepper. The perfect in taste and texture. The cheese was marinated properly and the balance flavors along with the drink was pure heaven. \n\nArancini cheese poppers: this was something new in arancini. The cheesy poppers along with the salsa sauce and cheese cream. The best presented dish. The perfectly cheesy balls going well with the tomato salsa. \n\nIn main course we wanted to try their kofta, as it was suggested by the staff. The kofta had a rich red thick gravy along with the Indian spices. The kofta was made-up from paneer and herbs. The quantity was sufficient. And can be eaten with Roti or biryani. We had missi roti, tandoori roti and Nawabi biryani.\n\nThe biryani was really rich and royal. The flavors were really amazing. Little more spicy then expected, but tasted really well. The rice was cooked properly and was not dry. The veg biryani lovers must try this here. the Indian herbs has enhanced the taste of the biryani. \n\nThe last segment was THE DESSERTS \nTiramisu: the mascarpone cheese along with vanilla cake and a strong flavor of coffee. This was mesmerizing and amazing. The taste was good. Coffee had a strong flavor in this dessert. Also, \n\nMelting chocolate cake: a melting lava cake was served along with the butterscotch ice-cream. The preparation was really like a melting chocolate. A dark flavored chocolate was just perfect and mouthwatering. \n\nGold dust Cappuccino: Heard of this, but never tasted before. The Golden sprinkle on Cappuccino. This has made our meal. The edible sprinkle was garnished on the Cappuccino. The strong Cappuccino had a great taste along with the creamy milk. A must must try drink.\n\nOverall had a great time with family. The staff has made our meal a great meal. Special thanks to @live_life_royal for amazing meal experience.",

Mr Vijay served and assisted us gratefully.\nFor starters we tried the gosht galouti and the murg pahadi kebabs. Both were intrinsically delicious and made us crave for it more. The kebabs were made perfectly with the ingredients mounted just to the mark.one of the best kebabs i had. For drinks we ordered the virgin mojito, it was refreshing and chilled.the juicy extract of lime was oozing and freezing and refreshing our minds. The Sheryl temple was also good. The lemony chilling taste made us a fan of it. The lamb messy burger was so good that im still fond of it.it was like a treat to our stomach. Personally recommended.\nIn the main course we had the murg lahori with cheese garlic naan.The chicken was cooked well and the gravy with it was delicious. If u are a chicken craver then this shud be on ur eat list. With the cheese garlic naan,it was on to a whole new level.damn it was yummy.\noverall the place is worth visiting and i wud like to visit the place again soon",

We had a couple of Lipstick and fruit shoot mocktail. \nComing to the appetizers, we had tandoori chicken lollipop, veg corn nuggets which were scrumptious. Decided to have barbeque chicken pizza, spaghetti for main course. Looking forward to visit again and try the rest of the menu.",

I've been a frequent visitor here and I've had one hell of a night every single time I've visited this place. They've come up with this new beautiful entrance which is decorated with golden fairy lights. They have a huge green wall opposite the entrance as its selfie point. Yeda Republic is an evil styled lounge bar with space suits and dark alleys. The lounge bar is located underground in the basement with Carribean flags with life like props wearing space suits, gas masks and respiratory pipes while you walk your way down. They have huge a jeep like structure located right in the centre where cute little staff members dressed up in spacesuits dance during weekends. Dark zones, Gas chambers, Ceiling with human bodies strapped with masks, ropes, jute bags, tunnel-like entry to the restrooms, waiters dressed like prisoners in orange one-piece suits are some of the traits of this lounge. The bar counter is clearly the highlight of this place with large cylindrical pipes which drop down from the ceiling and houses the Bar Bottles, for the rest of the display. They also have a fancy telephone booth with 5 ancient telephones. Talking about the food, the menu is a little compact when it comes to food. One thing they could work on is their menu. They have a wide bar menu but only 4 mocktails and 3 desserts in all. Also, I'd recommend y'all to place your order for maincourse and desserts along with the appetizers itself as they take a while to prepare the food.\n\nWe'd ordered :\nIn Mocktails :\n1. Fruitshoot - Mixed fruits blended with sugar and vanilla ice-cream. The taste was good. If you like your drink sweet, you can opt for this one.\n\n2. Lipstick - This is a tiny glass of mocktail having a very attractive red colour consisting of orange, mint, cranberry juice and peach crush.\n\nIn Cocktails :\n1. Bloody Mary - This is our all time favorite, red colored spicy cocktail which will surely get you in the mood.\n\nIn Appetizers :\n1. Cheese Corn Nuggets - Seven pieces of nuggets having melted cheese, corn and capsicum in its filling served with a dip. They are medium spicy in taste. \n\n2. Chicken Lollipop - Six pieces of chicken legs served with green chutney. They have a tangy taste. \n\nIn Mains :\n1. Chicken Sphaghetti Pasta with Pesto Sauce - They have three options in pasta base, ie. Sphaghetti, Macaroni and Penne Pasta. We'd opted for Sphaghetti Pasta in Pesto Sauce with chicken as its add on. It's served with two long garlic breads, garnished with cheese and black olives.\n\n2. Chicken Makhani Pizza - This is a thin crust pizza which has Makhani sauce in its base topped with chicken pieces and cheese.\n\nIn Dessert :\n1. Paan Falooda - I'm a huge paan lover so went for this one. This a satiating glass of falooda with paan syrup, jelly, almonds, cashews and french vanilla ice-cream.",

Mao family restaurant is famous for its Kepsa, Mughlai, chinese, Indian, Tandoori and seafood especially  Its tasty and yummy dishes like😍 kepsa of different types, fried rice, one pot biryani, caramel pudding, rabdi and many more. I loved the fact of having a big plate of Chicken hyderabadi Kepsa with reasonable cost which increased my excitement to visit this family restaurant. I have visited this place with family and friends many times and this place has always been very near and dear to my heart.❣️ The best part is the Kepsa spcl. Every grain of rice is cooked, the chicken meat cooked fantastic nice and juicy. 🍗Right from its presentation to its apettite this dish is absolute heaven. I am very sure of going back to this place again once lockdown ends. And i really recommend to visit this restaurant because its one of the best to serve good amount of food in reasonable and affordable cost.😍🥗😋😋😋😋",

Tasted good.\n.\nMelting Grill Sandwich - This one is a must try. Filled with loads of cheese and mayo, loved it. Highly recommended.\n.\nMexican fries - French fries with cheese, tomato sauce, chili flakes and pepper was a different combination for me.

The restaurant is under renovation so we were asked to sit out in the garden accompanied by stray cats, hoards of mosquitoes and flies. I don't know what was worse, the sound and smell of flies and mosquitoes being electrocuted right at our table or smell of mosquito repellent or the pieces of coal in our nan or the stale paneer or the cold chicken soup. Eventually, I suffered from food poisoning, my brother had severe acidity. So yeah, it was an ultimate letdown. Just stay clear out of this one. There are better places available If you wanna spend a premium price for a dinner with fowl and flies around you. 2 stars just because it used to be nice in the past.",

They come up with these seasonal menus which is excellent.\n\nTried a couple of dishes here from the summer and the new menu. Loved a few.\n\nDo try the Sichuan Sliders. They were delicious. Crisp patty, spicy sauce.. one lipsmacking slider. The noodle bhel salad accompanied was to die for.\n\nThe potato wedges were crisp and delicious. Loved the seasoning.\n\nCrispy cracker mousse from the summer menu.. creamy smooth Mushroom mousse and spicy guacamole topped over a crisp cracker. It was quite good. A balance of textures..  creamy, spicy, crispy and smooth.\n\nPower protein salad from the summer menu.. this salad was delicious. Loved it. Chickpeas, Arugula, almonds, edamame and quinoa with a super delicious dressing.\n\nRed and black combo from summer menu.. Manipur edamame black rice served with a coconut based chickpeas and Vegetable curry. This dish was delicious and healthy.\n\nSweet curd with mango .. from the summer menu.. a delicious yougurt with mango sorbet..I quite liked this one.\n\nChocolate Churros... Oh so good. Loved them. Do try!\nBig fat churros drizzled with dark, milk and white chocolate and served with more Chocolate sauce.\n\nPaneer Makhani sizzler... This one was decent..but my least favourite since I'm not a Makhani fan. The pulav was delicious. The paneer was melt in the mouth soft.. the gravy was a little sweet for my liking.\n\nCottage cheese rolls with Crunchy oats... These could have been better. The cottage cheese and the sauce within was delicious but the outer skin can be worked on.\n\nKashmiri kawah/twings and berries.. both the teas were good.\n\nOverall a good experience.",

Tea is served hot throughout the day. There is air conditioned segment for those you can't sit without cool air. You get snacks, proper meal and starters through out the day.

Chicken chilly dry was good in terms of taste and portion size. But the rice was a little undone, it had a bite, I understand Chinese fried rice normally has a bite in them as they get cooked when being tossed in the wok. But here the case was different, rice tasted hard because it was undercooked. But overall I found the taste, quality and portion size good enough. Will surely order again. Btw I loved their Schezwan chutney, Im not very fond of it bcos of added colours but I tasted this and I must say its exceptional, kind off homestyle.",

The Murg Mussalam , butter chicken, noodles, fruit punch and other bunch of starters are perfect. But after the renovation I visited the place and I asked them what’s new food items. He said the same old dishes and when I asked what’s new other than tht, then he did not have any clue. I asked for a new kebab type starter for which he suggested chicken ghee roast. It was not good, there was no taste of ghee nor was it roasted, you can see in the picture that it wasn’t served like a kebab but like a main course side dish. Taste wasn’t upto the mark. I also ordered a fruit punch to set my mood, which was classic, tasty! But nothing new in the drink menu. For main course I ordered Chicken Patiyala, and I have to say that it was the most uninteresting looking dish I have had. Chicken patiyala consists of a base of chicken stuffed omelette which is topped with a great tasting gravy. But here at neel Kamal, it was just a plain chicken curry and they topped the whole subzi with a huge omelette. We literally found just omelette in the dish, there were like 4 small pieces of chicken in the dish. The quality of the restaurant got degraded. The ambience of restaurant has been pretty good. I wish they try to change their dishes and add new menu items with a well versed waiters.",

Also, the place is always clean and serves healthy drinkibg water. While the place is not very huge, the staff is very helpful and sweet. You can hangout here with your friends and family members. No alcohol is served but you'll get soft drinks and other beverages like coffee, shakes, etc. All this comes at a very affordable price. I choose Siciliano over any other place for the pizzas. Cheesilious it is!!",

They serve various cuisines. I find this place more happening for there pizzas and pastas. I love there pizzas as they serve thick crust pizza. We have tried almost every pizza on the menu and loved it to it's bit. Base is fresh, toppings are fresh and love the thickness of the sauces. They serve both vegetarians and non vegetarian pizzas,  pastas, burgers and sides. \nWe love Chicken tikka pizza with cheese burst. The cheese they add just melts and flows in your mouth like that. We also had BBQ pizza it was okay okay. \nIt's a very well known place for pizza in spite surrounded by very well known pizza places.\n \nService is bit slow and they don't pay attention till you call them. That should be taken care of. \n\nFood - 🌟🌟🌟🌟/5\nAmbience - 🌟🌟🌟/5\nService - 🌟🌟🌟/5\nPrice 💸💸💸\n\n__\nFollow @we.eat.everything.delicious on *Instagram* and Follow We Eat Everything Delicious on *Zomato* for more yum content.",

All of them were flatteringly amazing . Everytime you be here there is an equally flabbergasting and ambient gesture you get as you are being treated as a humble guest at their best. They are cordially amazing people who would rather be the hosts to enrich the ambience and hospitality of this place which would go hand in hand.\n\nThe Small and Compact sized rotis are ensuring the best for your Diet quotient that is what these people have got in store for you. \n\nThe exquisite set of Desserts and Sweetdishes include stuffs as per your concern. From pan shots, Mastanis to what not . Every nook and corner of countryland cuisine is taken into consideration here.\n\nI appreciate the decorum and decors which go here hand in hand with that pitch of demanding excellence of plush interiors .\n\nWould love To be here again sooner !! \n\nKudos to The Team Grand Thali, Tip Top plaza .",

The catering was decent not extra ordinary as such. The evening reception had one type of mushroom starter with kokam and one more welcome drink. Kokam hardly had the kokam flavor in it. Did not try the second drink. Mushroom cheese starter was ok ok types. The main course had panipuri at the start comprising of both cold water Pani Puri and hot ragda Pani Puri. The other items were phulka, naan, puri, mix veg bhaji, paneer masala, akrodh halwa(super heavy and delicious), malai cheni, veg biryani, raita, salad, papad, pickle, chana, tomato, cucumber, beet, etc. There was another sweet which looked like made from sewai. Lastly, the course summed up with roasted almond ice cream and butter milk. Overall ok and definitely could have been better.",

The mushrooms were heavenly and left us salivating for more! The chicken was spicy and a little salty due to the flavour combination of acchar but definitely succulent. \nJumping onto our absolute favourite Butter Chicken, we decided to pair it with Chilli Cheese Naan and Stuffed Chur Chur Kulcha. The gravy was creamy and sweet, great quantity with bite sized pieces of chicken which we loved! More so the naan with the perfect amount of cheese. The kulcha could be savoured all by itself with the masala stuffing. \nWe would absolutely suggest this place for a wholesome and happy meal!",

Was excited to hear that they recently opened a delivery and takeaway outlet near Vama, Kemp's Corner Flyover, Pedder Road! And finally I decided to visit this new one.\n\nFirst thought, I would do a takeaway, but there is space for about 6 to 8 people to sit and eat at the outlet. So thought might as well do that! This outlet delivers to places in the radius of 4 kms or so, which means pretty much entire of South Mumbai. Indizza serves North Indian food - Appetizers, Rolls, Curries, Dal, Rotis and Desserts! In short a wholesome meal. They have reasonable amount of Veg and Non Veg options which I believe would cater to all.\n\nTalking about what all I tried at Indizza -\n\nWe started with few starters - Bharwaan Mushroom Tikka, Paneer Jeera Mirch Tikka and Aloo Achari Tikka. I would personally recommend these starters in the same order. Mushroom Tikka is too good, lipsmacking! In case one doesn't prefer mushroom, then one should go for Paneer Jeera Mirch Tikka, there are other options as well in Paneer Tikka. Paneer was soft and all appetizers came along with Pudina mint chutney and some onions. Aloo Achari lacked the taste though.\n\nWe ordered for some drinks. Besides the regular soft drinks they serve Nimbu Pani and Pudina Nimbu Pani! Nothing fancy about it and the drinks were also served in basic bottles, but effective and refreshing taste to go along with the food!\n\nNext from the rolls section, we ordered the Paneer Makhani Roll, wrapped neatly in an aluminium silver foil. Rolls are served in tandoori or Roomali roti! We had this roll in Roomali Roti. Yummy, the filling was too good, roti cooked well. No complaints at all. Would recommend people trying rolls as per their likings and preferences.\n\nMoving to the mains, we ordered for Dal Makhani, Paneer Tikka Masala. From the Rotis, I was really excited to try the Truffle Cheese Naan. Naan was cut in a way Pizza is cut. Stuffed with regular cheese flavoured with Truffle. Truffles have garlicky flavour and a peculiar aroma. I personally loved it, some may feel it to be pungent. So please use your discretion. For me Truffle Cheese Naan was the Highlight or Star of the evening! Dal Makhani creamy - rich - thick, perfect in taste. Paneer Tikka Masala adequately spiced and rich in flavour! What an awesome meal.\n\nFinally turned to desserts, tried the Gooey Chocolate. Served in a basic container, but loved the chocolate crumbles and topping on fresh swedish chocolate cake! Divine and perfect way to end!\n\nI am happy, that I decided to have my meal there rather than takeaway. Liked the overall experience, staff was courteous, Mr. Vijay was helpful! Would recommend all, do try Indizza, definitely worth every penny that you spend!",

They have interesting combinations of pizzas such as the Popeye pizza- which has spinach, onion and feta as toppings. This is a really unique combination but it works really well together. We also ordered the Bombay pizza which had onion and capsicum. We added truffle oil to this  which made it even better! They have many options to add on to the pizza as well. My favourite was the garlic oil which we added on almost all the pizzas and it was delicious. We also got the margarita pizza which is a classic but was still really good! All the ingredients they use are high quality which makes the experience even better. We also got the garlic cheese bomb which is super cheesy and unique. It comes with a spicy capsicum dip as well and is a definite must try if you go there! Although, the food was great I feel it had become very cold and rubbery by the time it came home and it would have been way better if we ate it there. Also, the food was delivered later than the time mentioned. But this place is definitely value for money and I will be ordering again.",

It almost took 20 mins for the starters to arrive.. 😌\n\nWe tried to be on a safer side and called for *Chilli Potatoes*. The dish was really good in terms of taste.. This is the dish which actually saved the night if you could say!\n\nWe also orderd Chilli Garlic Noodles, however the noodles seemed to be dry, and didn't bring out the Garlic taste much, however it was chilly as per the name !\n\nStaff were really helpful though 🙂",

They usually takes time to prepare but the wait isn't worth. \n\nBAR:\n\nThe bar has good menu options with various types of alcohols been served. The beer quality doesn't fit with your regular taste. I was not feeling like having it. So think before ordering.\n\nSHEESHA: They have herbal sheesha. Mostly it doesn't create much smoke but is good as compared to other sheeshas.\nThey have an hour limit for each pot. It was nice.\n\nPRICE:\n\nEverything is overpriced plus additional taxes are imposed. A small redbull can costed us around ₹220. All other food items were heavily charged. For no taste we paid excessively high amount. Totally dissatisfied with their pricing system. \n\nSERVICE:\n\nService was very prompt and the persons were very polite and well mannered. They obeyed properly and served professionally. 9/10 for them. \n\nOverall experience:\n\nFirst of all, the main factor is price and food. I was disappointed by both. There was no proper taste or flavour in food. Paying more for those were other issue. So, I don't recommend anyone to go here unless it's urgency for you. There are several more in area which gives best service.",

The dish had plain rice on the top and a layer of chicken gravy and egg at the bottom. They also served the Raita with it. Now coming to CHICKEN KHAPSA DELUXE RICE where the quantity is same as the Chicken Kahpsa Rice. For those prefer chinese can go for this as I found it better than the Chicken khapsa Rice coz It comes with a layer of chicken tikka topped with a layer of fried rice. And then comes the CHICKEN HAKKA NOODLES where the quantity is good enough for 2 medium eating people. Not to forget that it was delicious, not too oily and they served with shezwan chutney. In second visit i had CHICKEN TIKKA BIRIYANI and in this the quantity is enough for just one person served with Raita. It was awesome and spicy as expected. Not the best Ive had, but good none the less. Along with it i had DOUBLE CHICKEN DOUBLE CHEESE PERI PERI SHAWARMA which was cheesy and spicy and served with a mayonese layer on top. Most teenagers come here only for this. These. are one of the best you can get in Navi Mumbai. And lastly the COLD COFFEE which was chilled and thick and had perfectly strong flavour also was cheap and totally worth",

Place is very famous and very small as well, I waited for almost 30min outside in queue and 15 min to get my order and offered seats on sharing basis, no customer service ! Make sure  you have enough free time as there you may face a long queue and waiting time . The service may seem a little bit slow Just because of the crowd but the quality of the food is graet . No  Ac . Tables are very congested can't even sit and eat with comfortable posture, but taste is wow ! Sardar is very old outlet dating back to 1966 and known for its delicious buttery pav bhaji. They have maintained the same taste since then and the outlet seems to be always crowded with people and on weekends you have to wait for a hour or so to get seats. Must recommend for someone who wants to try out one of the best Pav bhaji !! Good by taste with loads of butter. It is having good service but too much of waiting specially during weekends as process is one round for parcel and one for having it there. It also serve milkshakes but it's costlier than it should be . Limited parking place .\n       Overall had an amazing experience over there and would love to visit this place again.",

I'll breakdown my review in few pointers\n\nLocation: Pretty far from Vasai railway station. This is a good hotel for the locals who live nearby\n\nAmbience: Great with good ventilation and seats. The restaurant also offers a music area where music is played in the evening. It also has bar area\n\nFood: The food quality is good and tastes well. I have tried some of the things in the menu and it has not really disappointed me\n\nPrice: Fairly priced the food can come upto 1000 approx for two people. With drinks it would be extra\n\nParking: There is a big parking space available downstairs for both two and four wheelers\n\nOverall review: Good for a weekend dinner. You can make reservations or walk in too. For certain occasions or festival do make reservations. The hotel is big enough to accommodate quite number of people. The staff is good and the hotel offers great value for money",

I was on the fence as to whether I should visit Gujurat, but if they cook like the chefs at Nimantran, I'm definitely going to go.  The menu is simple, there's a thali, but there's such variety with sweet, savory and spicy.  And it's a subtle spiciness so if you're a white person like me, don't be turned away.  Its 325 rupees for an all you can eat thali at dinner time, and the owner and staff were really welcoming and friendly guys.  I arrived at 7 on the dot so I had some time alone to talk with them and they answered any questions I had about any of the new exotic dishes.",

And many times the DJ was doing over remixes because of which the joyness of original song got destroyed . Otherwise the club is very spacious and awesome but a little expensive . Unfortunately They don't serve breezer and vodka . I am little disappointed by the availability of food \nMumbai's standards. Double ceiling roof, well lit and great music system.\nOf course it will come with a price, drinks are costly and so is a table if you don't fancy the idea of dancing for long or want to take a pause.\nWhole place is divided in half, the other half is seems a private place. On a Saturday night People start coming around 11 and its good number of people who visit.\nTrendy, late-night club offering cocktails & global fare, plus lively DJs, dancing & VIP \n1.Entry fees is 3000 rupees.\n2. Once you go inside you can not go out and re enter.\n3. There is no single chair to sit.\n4. Drinks costs avarage 1000 rupees plus service charge 10% plus VAT plus 2xGST. Photo of a bill is shared.\n5. The music is trance and very loud. Neither you can dance on it nor you can talk to your friends/Partner\n6. I could see barely 18 year old teens inside the club which made me uncomfortable.\n7. Club is divided into two. To enter the half where crowd is less and has seating arrangement, you have to pay hefty.\n8. If you want to sit at crowded area, you have to pay a big amount to book a chair.\nSuperb music superb vibes electric atmosphere on weekends that continues till 4 am in the morning. Visited this pub on a Saturday night. Entry was 3000 (Cover Charge) for couple, Food and drinks were fine, service was a bit slow but when you are in such an electric atmosphere dont realy care, Overall a 3/5 for food n service but a 5+ for the you atmosphere.",

We tried a couple of preparations like chicken cheese cigar rolls, nasi goreng, 145 mighty oreo shake, and butter chicken bao. Prices are bit on the steeper side and they've got very limited options so you need to choose accordingly. Table reservation is strongly recommended. Nice place to unwind with friends or go out on a date.",

The next day when I called 5 spice letting them know how tasteless the food was they stated that you should have called on the same  every day.when I already told him that we had the food at 1.30am. Later he tells me that you should have called before 12.00pm because the chef's were there till that time and only then this feedback/complain would have been considered. He also stated that we do not have a manager present at the moment and are working with minimum staff. I did tell him then why did you take the order when you guy's can't keep up to the mark of providing good food and service. When I told him that I will put my reviews he was all OK about it.

There was nothing to differentiate between veg and non veg that led me and my family members to confusion. Also, we ordered garlic fried rice both in veg and non veg. But only the veg one had garlic in it while the chicken did not. It was just a plain fried rice. Normally the quality is really good but today's food was a let down.",

Probably the staff noticed that too and smilingly gestured me to sit down, in seconds two of them came to clean the table, passed all the leftovers towards me, asked if I needed anything, although being part of their job, I could feel the extra warmth.\n\nSo kudos to the staff and thanks for the lovely gesture that day :)",

The dessert section is equally impressive. Tiramisu, Blueberry cheese cake, skillet cookies, sizzling brownie and so much more.\n \nThe unique feature is the salad bar. You can choose ingredients to make your own salad.\n\nThere is small bakery upstairs. Our kids went to see it too. \n\nThe service is quick and efficient. They kept clearing the tables as soon as we were done with the dish. The serving staff is very helpful and good natured.\n\nWashroom is available.\n\nIt's on a little expensive side but you get equally tasty food.",

After giving up on me she finally convinced my friends and we were there for a brunch last Sunday!\n\nIt's inside the famous Golden chariot restaurant on Andheri West SV road and operated by the same management itself. The ambiance has good-decent classic family restaurant vibe. \n\nThe menu on the other is poles apart from your usual golden chariot menu. \n\nWe ordered a lot of food from \n- non bread pizza\n- Sandwiches\n- Garlic (non) bread sticks\n- pulao\nTo \n- vegan Dahi Vada 🧐\n\nMust say, I was impressed with Non-Bread bread made of Rajgira (Desi quinoa) to vegan Dahi made out of almond milk(!?)\n\nIt all tasted nice and delicious for first couple of bites but nah I couldn't finish or gorge on any of the dishes. Although between four of us we managed to finish it all.\n\nGiving it 4 stars cuz if I was a vegan I would've truly loved it I must say. Also at the given price point how many Vegan restaurants do we have in this side of the bay is something which is unknown to an uninitiated like me.\n\nAll in all good experience, will definitely visit next time I'm out with my Vegan friends (I barely know 3 people who are True vegans so umm I don't know when tbh ;))\n\nMy only complain is the staff although very polite, patient and professional lacks knowledge about these Vegan dishes.",

Amidst a busy day at work, I often find myself looking for something tasty that I can almost never find the time to prepare. Thank god for trust worthy restaurants that are still hustling to keep us going.\n\nI recently ordered in from All Elements and was extremely happy with how seamless the experience was. Safely packed, promptly delivered and most importantly, delicious! \nHere’s wheat I tried:\n\n- Chipotle Chicken Tacos\nThis dish consists of 2 soft shell tacos generously filled with diced chicken in a spicy sauce and salsa. It comes with a side fresh sour cream to compliment the heat of the dish and some extra salsa if you’re looking to add some more. Quick to eat and we’ll balanced flavours. \n\n- Garlic Bread \nThis ones a classic, no messing around with the OG. Bread that’s toasted to a buttery crisp, topped with smashed garlic and herbs, how can one go wrong? Loved that this reached me crisp and not wet and soggy from condensation. \n\n- Fettuccine Carbonara\nI save this dish for days I feel indulgent. A rich creamy sauce, bacon strips and mild herbs. Simple, flavourful, rich and delicious. It comes with a little garlic bread too :) \n\nI generally visit all elements cafe but haven’t been able to due to the pandemic. I’m very very glad that I can still enjoy my favourites at home without any fuss. Definitely worth checking out in my opinion.",

Absolutely loved our pepperoni pizza, was made very well. Got just 3 pieces in Mushroom Bruschetta, it was yum but not happy with the portion size as per the pricing. Garlic bread was ok, cold coffee was spilled in the bag and didnt have sugar in it. Overall food taste was good. Needs to focus on good packaging and appetizer quantity.",

Very attractive moktail for pictures clicking. Balance sweetness & was perfectly prepared.\n\n2️⃣-Next i tried garlic bread there were 4 pieces in a plate and garlic bread was too tasty n soft the size of the bread was quiet large but they don provide u any sauses or chutney with it. As the taste is little different so you can enjoy without chutney or any sauces\n\n3️⃣:-Then i tried chiken platter it was very very mouth watering cheese 🧀 was topped over it  platter was garnished with some carrot and cabbage also a bowl of green chutney the chiken was very soft and marinated with garlic 🧄 ginger paste along with some spices in it we luved it i would like to rate 10 out 10 to this chiken platter\n\n4️⃣- And the last i ordered chicken crispy tempting 🤩🤑 and this chicken crispy was garnished with coriander . I like the taste was not so spicy u can have it some szhewan sause as per your taste or its a good option to start your dinner 🥘\n\n➡️Ambience-  It's  an Indo-western fusion restaurant and bar.They have an outside seating as well as well-decorated dim indoor ambience with full of load music with attracts so much.\none of those places which has a really quirky ambience and a unique way of serving food.\n\nAmbience-5/5\nService-5/5\nTaste-5/5\nworth for money-5/5",

We had been here recently again, situated@N.S. road, near Panch Rasta, Mulund West!.\n\nThe surrounding ambience has pleasing vibes & aroma is soothing too!. The decors are well lit & gives the feel of its long lavish legacy of generations!.\n\nThe staff here is very friendly & prompt while placing several orders & suggestions & serving hot too!.\nDharmendra, incharge for our table was very attentive to recommend & serve with delight!.\n\nLet's checkout the food we had ordered here, \n\nPapad Churi was totally crunchy & tossed up with onion & chaat!. You just can't stop after one bite!.. It's all time regular favourites for most of the tables!. Surely try this dish for starters!.\n\nWe next ordered Chinese Platter, it was finger licking & platter had sufficient quantity for sharing wise!. Several Chinese items include manchurian balls, Vej crispy, paneer chilli & spring rolls & salad in sidings!.\n\nWe also had Paneer Tikka Dry, it was mouthwatering to glance & craving for more!. The spices were nicely blend & paneer was coated crisply & lip smacking!.\n\nPaneer Cheese Tikka, is a nice fusion of seasoned paneer & over loaded cheese!. If you love both, surely go for this tikka, it's finger licking awesome!.\n\nBhagat Tarachand Special Thali  gives a glimpse of its succesful tradition it carries!. Balanced so well with ghee chapatis, 2 sabji of own choice, papad, dal, raita etc!. It's wholesome & flavourful by all means!.\n\nGulab Jamun is tender soft & sweet to its core, lingering sweetness for a long time to cherish!. Surely good to try Gulab Jamuns for dessert!.\n\nIcecream slice looked tempting & every slice of it was yummm!! After heavy dining, it's truly a bliss to pounce on desserts like this for sweet tooth lovers!.\n\nB Bhagat Tarachand is a proven excellence & you surely visit this place quite often to experience it's awesome treat & hospitality!. Thankyou!. ❤\n\nFood - 5/5\nAmbience - 4/5\nPrice - 4/5\nService -5/5",

I know this place since, I was a stubborn kid who often visits & live here in his elder brothers house and I know this place better than anyone who visits here. Since, Baba expanded its business and had a very successful items to have here. The very first offered here is their best & in hand item called Mixed Ice Cream Falooda with Extra Dried Fruits. Many others such as Black Current Falooda, Royal Malai Falooda & Baba Double Special Falooda with your own choices of topping given you within their branded box has a very servile appeal. I assure you that anyone who will have it here will never regret to do so here at Baba Falooda!\n\nIf it helped you some how to find about Baba Falooda! then leave a like so that I will get more deep -_*",

Why street food, because you are standing on the street, eating the food in plates kept mostly on the bonnet of your car\n\nThe food is actually cooked in a semi open, semi covered kitchen, so in a way only half street food\n\nDon't worry, everybody is doing it, that's the way to enjoy it\n\nA totally different atmosphere virtually impossible to get in a place like Mumbai\n\nI have been to a few typical highway dhabas in Punjab, the food tasted almost as authentic as that, and the same goes with the liveliness of the place\n\nAs usual, my family was worried about me being a vegetarian, but I fully believe in मेरा भारत महान ... They didn't disappoint me. Had some great authentic rotis and sabjis\n\nIf you are a Mumbaikar and haven't been to Bademiya, you are missing something big in life\n\nLike I said, it's different 👌👌👌",

Lebanese platter will win your heart with the variety and taste and presentation! A must try when you here. We had strawberry smoothie and hot chocolate! Poles apart, both of them were amazing! We also had strawberry cream cheese tart! Season of strawberries and this perfect dessert just was like the strawberry on top of the cake! Had a great time, thank you! Will visit again soon :)",

You can actually get pieces of the berries while you sip on it! \nWe asked for a Lebanese platter, cause hummus is bae! And it was an assortment of various items, which were packed with flavor!\nWe moved on to having and avocado salad, with green apples, and they had the flavor on that just right!\nFor mains, we asked for a beef steak, which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!\nWe finished off with a delicious strawberry tart! \nThe entire experience was superb!",

How did we ever not call for Biryanis from Behrouz? \n\nWhen we called for a delivery from this Biryani speciality joint we didn't know it was this big and when the order came, our entire house got filled with the rich aromas of the Biryani that came!\n\nWhat we had: \n\nPaneer Subz Biryani: This definitely would be those slow cooked dum biryanis for the vegetables, the masalas and the perfectly seasoned and soft paneer cubes were so beautifully cooked and carried so much flavour that we were floored by how they must've achieved this. Even the rice was cooked to perfectly and so rich with the aromas or spices that each bite was delightful! Even the pudhina curd and the gravy it came along with were absolutely delicious and we couldn't have asked for more.\n\nFalafal-e-Khaas: A little flavour bomb, these falafal-e-khaas nuggets were the perfect appetizers to our main meal.\n\nChaas: Nice refreshing chaas that went perfectly with our food.\n\nGulaab Jamun: Soft warm balls of sweet heaven. These gulaab jamuns were the perfect end to a scrumptious meal. \n\nHave you tried Behrouz Biryani yet? If not, do try for sure!",

As it's the place serving variety of veg and non veg options I thought of giving a try to this place.\n\nI ordered following dishes from belly darbar\n\n1. Chicken chimichurri: spice alert extremely spiced but tasty chicken tikka like starter with green mirch tadka and well cooked fresh chicken. I loved it.\n\n2. Cheese melt stuffed mushrooms: this was something I tried for the first time turn outs to be the best. Cheese and paneer stuffing made mushrooms tastes heavenly. The green chutney accompanied it well.\n\n3. Hyderabadi Veg Biryani : it was not the regular mainstream biryani but the aromatic long grain rice prepared with goodness of veggies and creamy white sauce gravy. It was different and very tasty.\n\n4. Butter Chicken Roll: Highly Recommended. I loved it totally. The butter chicken stuffing was so tasty and consistency was well maintained as it goes into a roti. The butter roti outside was so yummy it was very long and heavy. Its sufficient for 2 people.\n\nI loved the food which I had from belly  darbar the quality and quantity both were amazing. The packing done by them is really appreciated. Food was served hot and fresh❤💯",

Roll stuffed with loads of paneer pieces marinated in makhani gravy, which is not so spicy & creamy, is definitely a great choice for those who love non-spicy food. Also, this roll is pretty great at quantity, which may suffice one person’s meal.\n\nHyderabadi biryani: Packed with flavours, this biryani is for sure my best one, with some additional secret taste that makes this one worth having. Caramelised onions on the top, a layer of biryani with tasty gravy & paneer pieces was too good when it comes together! Must try!\n\nOverall, my experience with Belly Darbar was amazing, they’re also maintaining appropriate hygiene levels, packed well, and great food with amazing quantity! They have an elaborate menu you can pick from! Check them out and call for it today!",

My association dates back to a misty morning in August 2005, when six friends trudged together for almost an hour, covering three (or maybe four) kilometers in search of a hearty and filling breakfast. Less than a month in Navi Mumbai, we still showed some reluctance to vada pav and maisal pav (of course that soon got added to our list of favourites). What started off with parathas on that day, continued with thalis, combos, makke di roti and sarson da saag, just to name a few. This place suits all your requirements, a small party with friends, not feeling like cooking, something to suit your taste and budget, office breaks, in short anything. The best part is you can order anything and rest assured that you will like it. Oh yes, I forgot the chhaas, the best accompaniment for all your orders.\nThanks Naveen Ji for making our life more beautiful and happier.",

They are no where compromising on their food taste. \nAt my first I have posted pictures of paneer paratha.. It had only paneer and no potatoes or onions in it... Well astonished  to know that..... Will visit more often..... \nMy second visit to this place I choose to have the Methi Palak Paratha, Spring onion and Pudina Paratha followed by 2 Sada Paratha with Rajma...We were 2 people sharing all this couldn't finish it though so leftover was a takeout for us. You can see in the images that they actually  have the veggies that you ordered for no potatoes  as binding as most place you see that. \nThe lassi was soothing not too sweet not too heavy just right.\nA second visit was really memorable had loads of dishes as we were in a group. \nWe ordered for Maharani Thali, Laccha Paratha Thali and Paneer Paratha Thali followed by a Special Bimal Paratha. \nI can describe the dishes as much as I want but I won't be doing justice to the food served.\nLipsmacking taste and actual foodgasm.",

Luckily one afternoon, it wasn't much crowded, so decided to check this out with my colleagues.\nNow don't expect fancy ambience, it's a simple place, very famous for parathas, and that's the only thing we ordered - different types of parathas (I didn't try other cuisine like thali, or rice items). \n\nThe price starts from around 80rs and goes till 180-200rs depending upon the filling. Seeing the price I assumed there will be two parathas, so confirmed with the waiter, but was shocked to know it was the price of a single paratha. There are various combination of fillings, i decided to go with make your own paratha with any 3 fillings, i chose paneer, onion, and potato. \nIt takes time for the food to be prepared and served as they are freshly cooked and served. The paratha i ordered was served in 4 pieces with green chutney & curd, i mix them to get a good mixture. One bite into the paratha, and i could feel that they are very very generous with the fillings, i was almost full in 2 pieces. Some of my friends who have less appetite managed to eat only 2 or 3 pieces of their paratha and had to take parcel of remaining pieces. \n\nFinal verdict - It's a heavenly place for paratha lovers, pleasr visit at least once for lip smacking hot parathas, and you won't be disappointed.",

Their staff behaviour is warm and courteous and will be willing to help you chose the perfect dish for you. I started my evening with their Vietnamese Ice Coffee, which is served with a portion of condensed milk to be added to your coffee. Truly amazing ! We also their their Dark chocolate milkshake, and God it was too good. In starters I had their chicken strips along with their Chicken Caesar Salad which was served very fresh and looked healthy. In mains we had their Chicken Steak, which was topped with a White Mushroom sauce, with a portion of veggies and garlic bread on the side. Overall, it was an excellent dish. We also tried their Chicken Sapo Rice, which is a must try if you are a Chinese lover. Great taste, great quantity. We ended this perfect evening with a lovely hot cup of Mochaccino. Overall, it was a delight to visit this place. Best wishes to Team Bombay Coffee House.",

This has wheat noodles, chicken, broccoli and soy ginger sauce as dressing. You get an option of half and full. Half portion is enough for one person.\n\nThe Protein overload is also a good one to try which has eggs as a part of the ingredients.",

This was one my favorite here.\nCambodian Curry : similar to the first one , but non-veg version of the same.\nSpicy Chilly Noodles : not as spicy as the name suggests , its a combination of sweet , spice and tango taste. The flavor combination is awesome.\n\nTaste : 5/5\nService : 4/5\nHospitality : 4/5\nTake zomato gold with you here for rescue while paying the bill ;)",

The waiting staff was courteous and well read on the menu. It was raining when we went there which just really elevated the experience on the whole.\n\nService 5/5.\n\nAmbience 5/5.\n\nWe started with two soups. The FRENCH ONION SOUP had a thick consistency and a mild but great flavor. Italian flavoring and the cheese garlic toastie made it a good start the meal.\nTHUKPA SOUP had a load of spices and had a Tibetan sweet and sour flavor. The soup has well-cooked thin noodles and pak choy.\n\nIn mocktails we had two shakes and two soda based mocktail ORANGE MOJITO and GINGER GARLIC SODA. Mojito was having lots of lemon in it and ginger garlic soda is perfect one to have here. RED VELVET SHAKE was my favourite and oreo lovers should try OREO CHOCO MILK SHAKE.\n\nFor starters, we ordered CREAMY MUSHROOM BRUSCHTTAS. It mainly consisted of finely chopped mushroom amongst other things. It was one of our favorite dishes ordered here. The crispy flavorsome bread topped with a creamy dressing was a mouthful of joy on a plate. The next starter was the VEG NUGGETS, that came filled with cheese and cream. The dressing and crispy nuggets can be good siders for when out drinking with friends, or even otherwise!\n\nThin crust, vege-loaded and tangy-ish BOMBAY MASALA PIZZA was amongst the many things that tasted delightful. Main courses we ordered, included a ‘proper italian’ PENNE ARRABIATTA RED SAUCE PASTA. One bite of it and you can clearly know that the red sauch has been made by the café from scratch, giving it a fresh taste… Something we always look for in red pasta. The very popular GODFATHER VEG BURGER was specially recommended to us by the waiting staff and they were right about doing so. The burger was a handful, with two patties and cheese, dressing and veggies. The other one was a VEG PARMAGGIANO BURGER with a potato, veggies and seasoning filled patty. Both the burgers were sided with very crispy and fresh French Fries.\n\nMoving on DESSERT OF THE DAY… A pastry with White Rum infused dark chocolate. It was bitter-sweet and really rich. BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE was how a cheesecake should be. Very rich, dense, creamy with a very-berry flavor and a crispy biscuit base.\n\nThupka 4/5.\nFrench onion soup 5/5.\nOrange mojito 3/5.\nGinger lemon 4/5.\nOreo choco milk shake 4/5.\nRed velvet shake 5/5.\nVeg nuggets 4/5.\nCreamy mushroom bruschetta 5/5. (must order)\nGodfather veg 4/5.\nVeg parmaggiano 4/5.\nPenne arrabiata red sauce 5/5.\nBombay masala pizza 4/5.\nDessert of the day 4/5.",

One of the most legendary cafés has to be Cafe Military.\n\nLocated on a busy street in Fort, Mumbai, this café may not look like much on the outside but has character on the inside. Just enter the restaurant and seat yourself. You only have to wait for a few minutes before a server comes to take your order.\n\nYou must have their Irani Chai. This is one of the best I have had. This light chai is packed with lemongrass goodness. And no chai is complete without some Bun Maska. They add tutti-frutti to their bread and slather plenty of butter.\n\nI do recommend their cheese toast as well. While vegetarians don't have a lot of options for a hefty meal, you have enough choices to have a light snack. Most people do visit Cafe Military for its affordable range of alcohol.\n\nService is no frills. The servers are sweet. They come, take your order, and give you your food as soon as possible. \n\nI hope Cafe Military starts providing more options for vegetarians. For now, I'll always go back for their tea.",

He had heard of candies, as had I, from multiple friends who had raved about the food and environment. Since Candies is literally right next to the Cuckoo Club (A+ on location you guys!), we decided to eat at the popular joint. \n\nThough we had come about 2 hours before closing time, there still were a lot of menu items which weren't available. So unfortunately I was not able to try a lot of the items I wanted to. \nWe ended up choosing the BBQ pizza, which was alright, but was very filling. However the drinks were on point and I had no complaints. For all the food we had, I’d rate it 3/5\n\nSince neither of us had been to Candies, we wanted to see what the gossip was all about! Clearly we had no idea that the food is not the only thing that is said to be excellent at Candies but the structure is something to be praised at as well. I had initially thought the main floor and a second floor was the entirety of the joint, but as we started to ascend floor after floor, I definitely started feeling I had entered Wonderland. We had legitimately gotten lost because of how huge the place was!\nThere is an area for everyone here! A area to plug in your earphones to quietly study while huge groups of friends laugh loudly multiple floors beneath you, secluded nooks for candle lit date nights and many spacious spaces if you ever wanted a private event. \n\nI have never seen a joint that it structured like this.. it's so indie and artsy that the vibe makes the entire ambience. Totally loved it! Ambiance and location is definitely 10/5!",

Currently there are two branches in Mumbai - one at Ghatkopar East, and other at DN Nagar, both walking distance from the metro/railway station. The menu is 100% Vegetarian, and 95% of the dishes can be made Vegan. There are Vegan versions for butter, cream and cheese. My personal favourites on the menu are - Mango achaari chaap, Afghani Chaap, CKC signature chaap, CKC Vegan cheese gravy chaap, Soya mutton chaap, soya meat chaap and to be frank everything on the menu!

Lucknow strongly dominates the culinary culture of our country with its profound traditional delicacies and spices. The reason why Lucknowi food is so popular and loved is the fact that traditional food is given a royal flavour and this awadhi custom is passed on since ages and will continue for the years to come.\n\nVery recently ordered a Lucknowi meal from Chakh Le Lucknow. They have focussed on this particular segment and have maintained a very short crisp menu.\n\nWhen you think about Lucknow, its majorly a fare for the nonvegetarians especially meat lovers however this kitchen has dishes for the vegetarians too.\n\nWhat I ordered\n\nVEG GALOUTI\n\nAs desired ! Melt in the mouth Galoutis. I dont eat mutton hence opted for the vegetarian ones. These strongly had flavour of black pepper and cooked to perfection. It's a blasting melange of flavours.\n\nCHICKEN ROLL\n\nVery spicy but delicious. Generous portion of chicken with lots of onion wrapped in a flour roll. It would be ideal in a multigrain roti as alot of people avoid maida these days. Tasted good with mint chutney.\n\nCHICKEN LUCKNOWI BIRYANI\n\nVery flavourful as I had thought of it. Served with smooth curd. The chicken pieces can be better and fleshy as these were very boney. Quality should improve.\n\nCHICKEN KORMA\n\nThis was my favourite dish amongst all. Loved the spices used and consistency of gravy. Recommended.\n\nSo if you desire some Lucknowi food you can give this place a try.",

They also specialized in Galauti Kabab, Shami Kabab & so on. \n\nThe delivery was done on time & packaging was really good without any spills. It arrived hot. \n\nWhat I Ate ~ \nMutton Galauti Kabab. ( 4 pcs ) \nMutton Kheema made in good amount of garlic ginger paste. It really melted in the mouth. Taste wise it was flavourful & good. It was served with green chutney which was good. \n\nVeg Paneer Lazeez.\nThick gravy with paneer pieces which was good. It was oily & had a very unique creamy flavour. Served with Ulta Tawa Paratha which was amazing. Overall really great. \n\nChicken Briyani. \nThe rice was cooked perfectly. The aroma was also great. The ratio of masala was decent. However the chicken pieces had more bone & less meat in it. Served with ratia. \n\nSo this place is must recommended for some great food. Do give it a try.",

It was suited to my taste as I'm not a fan of very spicy food. This came with raita which was slightly sour, and onion rings.\n\nTheir Ulta Tawa Paratha was unbelievably soft and huge. I had this with Paneer Lazeez which was extremely spicy. We also had Veg Galawti Kebabs (too spicy again) with chutney. The kebabs were soft, though.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend the biryani and the paratha.",

JUST ORDER IT\n3. Rajma Chawal (4/10): This might be worse than expected. Rice were cooked right, but rajma disappointed by being almost tasteless and nothing like what rajma should actually should taste. One had to order chole seperately just to finish the rice.\n4. Lassi (7/10): Not the best tasting lassi, but with aloo paratha, lassi just complements & enhances it. JUST ORDER IT.\n\nA special regard goes to green chilly, onion and lemon, without which the cuisine itself is incomplete. Ask for more and the staff doesn't hesitate to serve.\n\nAlso, the Punjabi Kadhi, that the staff offered, is worth trying.\n\nService : 9/10\nFood : 7/10\nAmbiance : 6/10\nQuality : 7/10\nOverall : 7/10\n\nExpensive : No\n\nWill I go there again : Yes\nWill I recommend to someone : Yes\n\nBottom Line :\nLooking forward for better Chole and Rajma...",

As the name suggests it's main dishes are of Chinese cuisine and hence I tried the their noodles. The packaging was done very well and the noodles looked tempting on opening up the box. The good thing is that it didn't disappoint me at all after tasting it as it tasted delicious.\n\nI'm surely going to order my noodles from here the next time and I think you'll should give it a try as well.",

They tasted really delightful and sumptuous. Also, there was a street food counter, but didn't try it out. It was a self serviced lunch. However, the buffet had limited food.

Amazing place to hang out with your friends and colleagues for sure. As it is located in Bandra, near corporate hub of BKC, it is crowded place. But the food and drinks severed here, makes it more crowded. \n\nThe venue is separated in two as lounge and restaurant. Continuous music will surely make you more relax than ever. Plus, humble staff makes you more comfortable. \n\nDrinks we ordered are \n\nBellini, sparkling wine with blended peach puree. The Seven Island Ice Tea, a perfect mixture of 7 prominent liquors like gin vodka, tequila, rum and juices. Nojito Kiwi, freshly blended kiwi mixed with citrus syrup and minty lemonade. Citrus Cooler (Pineapple), fab mixture of pineapple juice with aerated lemon juice.\n\nFood we ordered are,\n\nMurg Abadhi Tikka, marinated in pickling spices and deep-fried boneless chicken pieces. Lord of The Wings, spice marinated and deep-fried chicken wings. Spaghetti Aglio E Olio, spaghetti noodles pasta cooked in olive oil, garnished with herbs and served in red sauce with chicken. Regular French Fries with tomato ketchup. Cheese cake with sparkle of coco powder as a dessert.\n\nLocation: 5/5\nAmbiance: 4/5\nCuisine: 5/5\nDrinks: 5/5",

Texture of the rice was perfect adding up with all the chopped veggies. Loved it.\n\nButter Naan+Garlic Naan:- Always over butter Naan, I would choose Garlic naan at this place. Tikka curry and the garlic naan made up my day!!!\n\nAmazing 👌",

With an extensive menu covering Mughlai and Chinese cuisines you have a lot of options for a filling meal. Things I tried\n\nChicken Afghani Kebab - Tender pieces of finely cooked chicken with proper amount of marination. Abundant pieces and great taste.\n\nChicken Tikka Masala and Butter naan- This curry just won my heart. It was so wonderfully cooked that every serving with butter naan was heavenly. Would highly recommend to try this dish.\n\nChicken Tikka Biryani - This came with some amazing quantity. Enough though the masala in the biryani was a little in excess, that didn't affect the overall taste of the biryani.\n\nIt was a pure pleasure to savour the dishes from this outlet. I would highly recommend people to order from this economical delivery outlet for a lipsmacking meal experience. Gracias ❤️",

I must say, that it was almost impossible for me to find a flause in any of them.\nWhile the Reshmi Malai Tikka was perfectly charred and had huge chuncks of fresh and well marinated paneer, the Paneer Tikka Masala was loaded with abundance of flavours and the crispy Butter Naan only went on to enhance the flavours.\n\nI would highly recommend this place and feel free to order anything from the menu, as they make, all of it really well.",

So a quick look at their other outlet profiles and I am assured, it's good. Still, it's Zomato, yet, I did give it a try.\n\nSo a day was set, Sunday to be exact, the day of my Sabbath.\n\nThe spread was huge, literally, humongous. I explicitly remember, asking them to send me their best, was surprised to find out, they had so many bests.\n\nThe breads were fine and plenty, ranging from rotis to parathas, all pretty good (it's bread, not much judging there except if it's burnt). Coming to the meats, from the tandoori, we had the kalimiri kebabs and the white tandoori chicken, both were pretty good. The curries were chicken tikka masala and garlic chicken masala, the chicken tikka masala was pretty great, the garlic chicken faded in comparison\n\nQuite frankly, not wanting to drag this a long way, pretty much everything exceeded beyond expectations. The thing is, I have grown tired of these only delivery services, very few live up to the expectations.\n\nThe quantities delivered by most joints is horrible, food tasting sub par and nothing really justifies the price, but this is exactly where, Curry Me Up shines bright, they give amazing quantities, with lip smacking tastes and just the right price. Plus they deliver on time and that these days, is an asset.\n\nP.S. Do try their biryanis",

The bright lights and soft music makes it so peaceful and enjoyable.\nThe menu has vast range of dishes, with fish preparations, chicken, mutton.\nTheir motto is that South Indian cuisine is much more than Idlis and Dosas.\n\nWhat we ordered:\nIn Starters 🍢\n🔸Fish Fry Porichaphu 🐟❤️\nThis was a very tempting dish. Pomphret which was nicely marinated was served in red masala and fried. It had a nice tangy sweet taste. The covering was crisp with hint of spices and the sauce served along was tangy sweet. A must try!\n\n🔹Spice Rubbed Rawas ❤️💯\nRawas fish marinated with spices and yogurt and nicely grilled. The flavors were soaked in the fish. The dish was so well prepared that all I wanted to eat was this yummy Rawas. My new favorite.\n\nIn Cocktails 🍹\n🔸Cosmopolitan 🍸❤️💯\nOur usual favorite. This Cocktail was well prepared. Just the way I like it. Nothing can ever go wrong with Cosmo. Went perfectly well with the starters.\n\n🔹Mango Margarita 🍹❤️\nThis was tangy sweet due to the mango flavor but again a yummy boozy drink. Well served with sugar coated at the rim. It was an eye candy.\n\nIn Mains 🍛\n🔸Prawns Manglorean Sukkha 🍤❤️💯\nThis was a delight. If you want something light to go with your breads then this is it. This was so flavorful and tasty. Hint of all the spices nicely marinated in prawns. The prawns were in good number and juicy.\n\n🔹Chicken Chettinad 🍲❤️❤️💯\nThis was the best Chicken Chettinad. Spicy and tasty, with so many flavors. I could eat it everyday. Just like homemade gravies but much more flavors and spices. Too yum. A must must try here.\n\n🔸Malabar Paratha\nIt was served hot and crisp. Went really well with Chettinad gravy and the chicken pieces.\n\n🔹Appam ❤️\nThey've a special counter to make appams. And my mum loved it to the core that through out the meal she had more of appams. Beautifully made and served steaming hot.\n\n🔸Neer Dosa\nSoft and light. Non sticky and thin slices. The beauty of neer dosa. Just perfect.\n\nIn Desserts 🍦\n🔹Shahi Tukda ❤️\nFried bread stuffed with rabdi. The rabdi was so so good. Specially made by the chef. It was full of rich milky flavors.\n\n🔸Watalappam 🍮❤️💯\nSimilar to our beloved custard but a famous South Indian dessert made from Coco and jaggery. Only if you taste it then only you can understand what I'm saying. It was so soft and tasty. Loved it!\n\nThe service is a bit slow, but once you taste the food you'll be on a joy ride. The food is so well prepared and so delectable. Each dish is pretty unique and delicious. It is a melange of flavors dancing in your mouth.\nThe servers are well trained and will help you with your selections. You'll definitely leave with a happy stomach and a smile on your face.",

The mushrooms were well marinated and grilled that it tatsed beautiful. The dish would be more justified if there were more mushrooms added. But as a whole the dish was good.\n\nThe chicken tikka biryani was lovely. I was satisfied with my expectations the chicken was marinated well, being juicy & at the same time a tinch of spiciness. Would really recommend this dish to be tried.\n\nThe murg banjara kebab were good and the green chutney given went along well which balanced it all.\n\nThey also take huge corporate orders and deliver right on time, given the time crunch the food was delivered on time and was good.",

I'm so glad to have feasted on some out-of-this-world Spanish food on my travels through Spain. El Mercado is as good and as authentic as it can get in this part of the world. \nFrom the cozy little space, to the cutsey decor, they do take me back to the intimate restaurants in the bylanes of Madrid. \nStart of with some plump pimento stuffed olives & toasted bread that come gratis while you ponder on what to order. \nI recommend you try the Gambas Al Ajillo, cooked in a ton of really good olive oil, garlic & chilly flakes. Perfect to dip your bread in and soak up all of that flavored oil. For vegetarians, you can't go wrong with the Patats Bravas.\nAlthough I was really looking forward to the Paella, 🥘 this one was a little of a let down. We had the mix seafood one. But, the rice wasn't cooked through and the flavors weren't as punchy as I remember it to be in Spain. Although, I have to ad the calamari was surprisingly nicely done and not rubbery at all. The sea food is really really fresh! \nThey just have to work more on the flavors. It's also the priciest dish on the menu at a whopping 1300 rupees for a portion for 2 good eaters. That's really expensive for an average dish. \nI can't wait to go back and try some more food there though.",

                    "text": "Any Late Night Carver's for biryani then go for\nGo Biryan !!\n\nThey have 4 different outlets located in Mumbai till now.\n\nI tried the outlet located at Lokhandwala in Andheri West\nServing some pocket woth and tasty Biryani's with some other Mughlai and North Indian Dishes.\n\nA special kind of happiness when you recieve your order some 20 mins early and you just hogg in to enjoy the food.\n\nYes! You heard that right. Go Biryan tries its best to give the delivery most priority with a perfection of handle and care.\nSo you may need not worry about how the delivery will be? , will it be early or late? , etc etc...\n\nSo now lets start which what i got for my cravings.\n\n-> I tried the personal recommendation of\n\"BUTTER CHICKEN BIRYANI\" which was an absolute combo of butterchicken tossed and made with the indian rice with long size rice with amazing aromatic sense which will surely drool you to eat it faster. The taste was also up to perfection, the chicken pieces were plenty in number, the amount of rice and gravy they offer for a prince size box is enough for a person. You may go for this option if you are a big fan of Butter Chicken 😋.\n\n-> Later i tried my own choice of \"SCHEZWAN CHICKEN TIKKA BIRYANI\"\nA fusion of India & China, Chicken dum biryani with shezwan chicken tikka with a blend of spices with macro Chicken pieces with a classic dum in biryani. This can also be ordered in different size. Quite Aromatic and drool worthy for Biryani lovers in Mumbai\nThat are - Prince size, King size, or family pack which may serve 4 people.\n\nThe next on my ordering list is\n-> MUTTON SEEKH KEBAB accompanying Reshami Paratha which was a whole wheat paratha.\nThe Seekh made of Mutton Kheema with a less spice but i felt it could be better by a more marination and using spices a quite more in quantity. The quality was at its best. Presented with some lemon, coriander leaves.\nThe Reshami Paratha made of whole wheat ,even after the delivery it was easy to chew for more 30 mins. It would be better if you eat as delivered, it tastes way too good with seekh. But if you really wana eat seekh only except the biryani there are much more places to order the seekh kebab.\n\nSo my final call was the\n-> Phirni - Phirni made of rice served in Shikoras flavoured in cardamom, almond slices and pistachios its an amazing mughal indian based dessert. Specially made in different flavours in the holy month of Ramzaan, i got this dessert in odd time but with the same taste.\n\nSo i started my meal with some mouth watering Biryani and ended with India's favourite dessert Phirni.\n\nRating :\nTaste - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\nDelivery speed - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nAmazing place for late night cravers",

They have categories as per servings wherein \"king\" serves for a completely satisfying meal for two people. Their variety in starters is something that you must try. From rolls to tikkas to kebabs, we have tried it all and everything has set a new benchmark for us.\n\nThe packaging of food is commendable. We would only suggest if they can provide some Eco- friendly wooden cutlery along with the food, it would be very helpful.",

Paneer Tikka Biryani - This tasted really good and the caramelized onions were just amazing.\n\n2. Paneer Makhani Biryani - This tasted really good. It had sufficient amount of paneer and the taste was just perfect. Highly recommended! \n\n3. Paneer Makhani and Malabari Paratha - They went really well with each other.

It’s one thing to raise prices, but to make portions so small that they don’t even satisfy one person is really ridiculous! The pizzas are the only saving grace. Alcohol prices are also absurdly high. One can’t even enjoy a decent glass wine below Rs.1000 per glass. The management seems to have the misconception that they are some Michelin star fine dine restaurant! They need to come back to earth or people will stop patronising soon. \nThe earlier decor was bright and cheerful but now it’s become really dark and dingy, more like a lounge bar. Seriously wonder what the management is doing.",

With the weekend just upon us, we were craving for some delicious, lip-smacking food and having heard so much about this restaurant, we decided to order in. \n\nTheir menu consists of an eclectic array of dishes that fall under various cuisines, namely, Modern Indian, Japanese, Thai, Burmese and Chinese to choose from, which certainly leaves you spoilt for choice. \n\nDuring this current pandemic, hygiene and safety is of utmost priority. Well, I must highlight the fact that the food from Gymkhana 91 Bar & Kitchen was neatly packed and the restaurant had certainly taken steps to ensure that the food is safe and hygienic. Our order arrived on time and the aroma of the food was mind-blowing, and oh well, we just couldn’t wait to dig in.\n\nHere’s the brief of our meal:\n\n1) Burmese Khow Suey With Chicken Fillets – An aromatic, flavour-packed curry made up of ground spices, coconut milk, veggies and tender chicken pieces. It came along with noodles and was served along with 7 condiments – chopped green chillies and wedges of lime, crispy fried garlic, fried onions, sliced spring onions, crushed peanuts, boiled egg and crispy noodles. This curry was absolute comfort food and my absolute all-time favourite! Love the fact that the coconut milk added to the subtlety of the curry perfectly. This curry is a MUST-ORDER and is certainly worth every penny. Highly, highly recommended.\n\n2) Sri Lankan Chicken Sambal Curry – A fragrant curry made up of tamarind, curry leaves and a chilly paste. The Sambal curry also had a lovely subtle hit from the coconut milk and was served along with exotic veggies and pieces of chicken. Definitely another dish that is soulful and a complete delight to the palate. Highly recommended.\n\n3) Chicken Mussalam Masala – A rich, thick and delicious traditional orange Mughlai Chicken curry which comprised of pieces of chicken as well as chicken kheema, and best enjoyed with a naan, roti or rice. Tasted good.\n\nOn the whole, this meal certainly was a great start to our weekend and we were happy with the delicious, tasty food as well as the portion sizes. Certainly a great place to order food from as the food is not only delicious but also safe and hygienic. Will definitely order again!",

The next thing I was building my cart and let me take you through my experience.\n1 Paneer Lazeez: Start has to be with a starter and Paneer is always the go-to-dish for us Vegetarians. It turned out to be awesome as it was perfectly marinated and creamy. Paneer was tender soft, 6 thick cubes of marinated Paneer blended with Capsicums & Onions, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 👌👌👌\n2. Schezwan Combo Rice: Best of the lot, Chinese is my all time favorite and this was fabulous. The quality of rice was truly elegant and so perfectly cooked and blended with gravy with lot of veggies- beans, carrots, onions, spring onions, gherkins and Cucumber . The best taste and satisfaction achieved after a very long time having Schezwan Rice, HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 💥💥💥💥💥\n3 Subz Vilayat Dum Biryani: Biryani with fragrant rice , sauted onions on top, Masala blend was perfect and moderate veggies but delicious to give you that cherishable experience. The innovative piece here was use of Gherkins, loved that part HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 💥💥💥💥\n4 Paneer Achari Tikka Roll : Very good stuffing with enormous amounts of Cottage Cheese and Achari enough to give you an Umm experience, \nRECOMMENDED 💥💥\nAll in all a delightful experience, packaging is fabulous and precautions to keep the food hygienic were nice plus the messaging on the bag was delightful.

But not anymore!\n\nRecently I ordered my favorite meals from Gymkhana 91. I was very much happy with the precautions being taken by them. Parcel comes with detailed report of temperature checks. Food packaging is totally tamper proof and spill proof. I was absolutely not worried about hygiene looking this!\n\nI ordered kuber kulcha, paneer tikka biryani, lajawab shaahi paneer and breads. Kuber Kulcha would always be my favorite! Cheese stuffed kulcha. Paneer Tikka Biryani, comes with a massive quantity enough for 2-3 people. Super tasty and yummy! Lajawab Shahi Paneer is surely a must try! Loved having north Indian meal after sooo many days! \n\nDefinitely gonna check and explore new dishes from Gymkhana!",

The bar is heavily stocked and looks awesome. We tried variety of cocktails and food and I give full marks to the food. Our server was very helpful in helping us chose the right combination of veg and non veg food. Dumpling platter is a good way to start and try different varieties. Hakkatini, signature cocktails and Signature Hakka noodles are must try. Don’t leave without trying some dessert. Amazing experience and we had such an awesome family time.

Chinese as well as Indian preferably North Indian cuisine, Mughlai dishes, and of course sea food too. \n\nI visited the place on Friday evening and it was all packed by 9 pm. More of a family restaurant. I saw many a families having dinner there. \n\nGenerally I prefer to have non veg food but looking at a delicious menu here, I tried all vegetarian food and it was awesome. Appetizer as well as main course were delicious. \n\nTried a few mocktails and they were worth every penny you would end up paying. \n\nPinacolada: My usual drink. When in confusion, choose pinacolada. They had it perfectly. The blend was proportionate in a perfect way. Pineapple with coconut. Vanilla ice cream. \n\nFruit punch: Mix of fruits. I requested them to make it without sugar syrup and they rightly did so. Refreshing. Fresh fruits. One of the best fruit punch preparations, I had in recent time. A bit tangy. \n\nThe staff is very cooperative and helped me in deciding my orders. \n\nTandoor broccoli and paneer: Generally, these two are different dishes: tandoor paneer and tandoor broccoli. I requested them to have it combined and they obliged it happily. Served with green chutney and red sauce. Perfectly grilled veggies. Delicious. Luscious paneer. Broccoli too was delicious. Paneer topped with cheese and coriander. Broccoli also topped with coriander. Onion slaw topped with mint and lemon. Broccoli had mustard feel as it was marinated with mustard sauce. Paneer was grilled along with onion, capsicum, and pineapple. \n\nHara bhara kebab with galouti kebab: Melting kebabs. Galouti kebabs were better than hara bhara kebab but again this is sin comparing two food dishes, isn't it? Loved both the kebabs. Served with tomato sauce. Galouti kebab were made from beetroot. Filled with cheese and cream. \n\nIn main course, we had tawa mushroom along with chura paratha. \n\nTawa mushroom was cooked properly. Fresh mushroom. Gravy was perfectly fine. Goes well with chura paratha. Mushroom gravy had capsicum, bell peppers. Topped with coriander. Red gravy. Delicious. Paratha was something unique, it was more like warqi paratha. \n\nIn dessert, we had gulab jamun rabdi. Delicious rabdi topped with gulab jamun. Perfectly sweetened rabdi. Loved the dessert too. Chilled rabdi served with hot gulab jamun. Topped with dry fruits. \n\nOverall, this is a nice place. The food is good. They have given emphasis on hygiene also. Cleanliness was upto the mark.",

I usually preferred malwani sea food restaurants in thane but I was a little late and most of the restaurants close down at 3.30 pm only to open again in the evening. \nHence, after a little search, I found Harish lunch home which served mangalorean sea food and thought of giving it a try. Have to admit that it was a winning decision.\nTried the Bombay duck fry and Surmai and prawn thali. Every dish was packed with extravagant flavours from coastal karnataka. The curry leaves and peanuts packed curry was to die for.\nHighly recommended for all sea food enthusiasts!!",

Right from thier cheese sandwich, dosa ,to thier milkshakes all are delicious. Staff is courteous but service is bit slow during weekends due to the crowd. Best part is that it’s open till 12 and crowded always.\nWe had ordered Manchurian dosa and cheese chilli gril and both of them were yum. \nThier Mango and Kiwi milkshake are also delicious.",

The lighting was dim which isn't good for taking pics but enough to see what you're eating. We ordered the Zucchini Fritters which is an amazing dish served with mayo and shredded lettuce. Highly recommend for trying if you like zucchini. Then we ordered the Jain version of Monza Pizza. The crust was super thin and since it was loaded with veggies and cottage cheese the bread was bending, while I expected it to be crisp and sturdy. Nevertheless taste was good. We were disappointed with non availability of desserts we wanted that is Chocolate Fondue was available without fruits and also no Fudge Cookies were available. So we settled for the Lava Cake that was a small one with vanilla ice  cream. Overall average.",

It was purrfeectttt.. one of the best Prawns biryani o had till date. Not too spicy neither bland. It's little pricy as compared to other outlets where in we get similar seafood. We ordered the only two desert available there and both were good. Chocolate mousse and caramel pudding.",

Finding it can be a little difficult as we passed this place by twice and then finally saw the tiny door and sign-board. There are 3 seating areas - the ground floor which consists mainly of the bar, the Alice-in-wonderland-esque mezzanine floor and the outdoor seating area. The decor is amazing and the restored apartment vibe can be felt. There are tons of books and games to help you pass the time while you're waiting for your food. Veg and non-veg options are both great. We called for fries, sandwiches and flower-pot dessert. The fries and sandwiches were great but the fritters that came with the sandwiches were partially cooked and we had to ask the server to replace them - which was done in a jiffy. The only thing we did not enjoy was the flower pot as it didn't have any flavour and was just a big pot of ice-cream. \nA great place for hanging out with friends after work or on a lazy weekend.",

One can really taste the garlic so it isn't just an overdose of cheese. This is how a garlic cheese croissant ought to be made.\nThe chicken mayo sandwich is delicious. It is the old school/classic version without any novel 'twist' ruining it. Just soft white bread (without sides) with a very subtly flavoured chicken filling drenched in mayonnaise.\nThe chicken patties, which seem more like puff pastry, are fantastic. Creamy chicken stuffing encased within layers of flaky pastry firm enough not to start disintegrating or falling apart at each bite.\nThe mutton cutlets are crisp on the outside and firm on the inside. The fries that are served along with the cutlets are absolutely fresh and have a crunch.\nThe choco lava cake has a delicious crust and a soft, gooey centre. Just how it should be.\nAll the fare we ordered were fairly regularly available items, nothing really fancy. This eatery does them so well that a lot of other eateries serving similar items could use these as a template and learn from them",

What are you waiting for, head over to this small , tiny outlet that offers amazing delicious food and is worth every penny . Though the ambience might not appeal you but it is decent enough to have a dine for their awesome food.\nStarting with Paneer Tikka Roll , damn the roll was so heavy stuffed with loads of paneer and the sauce and taste just blends completely well . It is a perfect start to your dine.\nA perfect kick off lead us to Paneer Malai Tikka and Tandoori Soya Chaap . Soft paneer with the malai and onions garnished just mouth watering and something to crave for. Amazing, Tandoori Soya Chaap just perfectly made and couldn't ask much more..\nAfter a heavy start , we ordered laccha Paratha and Dal makhani . Loads of ghee on the yummy Dal Makhani is what all North Indians should definitely try. Laccha Paratha tasted okayish .\n\nOverall had a very decent experience. Fast service , delicious food is what defines this place.",

Frankly there's nothing much to write about the ambience or the décor but the food was not bad.\nThe burnt garlic noodles were strictly okay, with barely a trace of garlic in them. The Asian lamb in oyster sauce was a tad too salty. The bamboo rice seemed to be the only redeeming feature. In addition to tasting rather good, it was served in a unique bamboo container.\nThe extra point in my rating is for the behaviour of the staff. They were very prompt and rather friendly. Senior staff came over to enquire about the food, the staff served with a smile and everything we ordered was on the table in minutes. They definitely did well!",

A little heavy on the wallet though.\nWe had:\nLemon chili coriander chicken soup(5/5):\nThis was a very hearty soup, with a good quantity of veggies and chicken. It had a great flavour, spicy and tangy at the same time.\nChicken Taronest(5/5):\nThis was just YUM! Great orange sauce chicken, served in a noodle nest. The crispy noodles were perfect with the chicken. This was delicious and fun to eat :)\nStir fry lamb(5/5):\nNice sauce, and generous portion of lamb\nChicken Pan Fried Noodles (5/5):\nVery very good! The noodles were perfectly cooked and the gravy was really well seasoned.\nPot Rice(3/5):\nThis was the low-light, the gravy wasn't that great and it was too much for the rice, couldn't taste the rice at all. \nHoney Sesame Crispy Noodles with Ice Cream(5/5):\nAgain this was just wow. The noodles were coated with honey and were the right amount of sweet, they paired perfectly with the vanilla ice cream.\nHighly highly recommended!",

Even prawns were not fried good. We ignore it.\n.\n• Chicken Kheema - These is also same. No taste of kheema. We not even felt that kheema was spicy or not. We just knew kheema was hot and not have taste. After having this we fully disappointed. Our Last hope was Chinese only.\n.\n• Roti - Even roti also not cooked well. We complaint abut this to restaurant member. They were ready to replace but we ate half actually so we leave it.\n.\n• Hakka Noodles - It was okay to eat. So we had it becoz we don't have any option.\n.\n• Triple Schezwan Noodles - Quite Okay.\n\nI am not suggesting this place to anyone. Our money was fully wasted and not even felt that we actually ate something. Very bad experience.",

Spices were well balanced and filling of peas, potato, peanut and dal sprinkled with sev.\n\nGulab jamun was served hot and was yummy. It was soft on the inside with the right amount of sweetness.

Went there for a dinner date  with my wife as we both are vegetarian for this month. And not to say Little Italy is a pure Veg place having Jain options too.The restaurant is very easy to locate and has valet services. Would advise to pre book and come as it gets busy during rush hours. The place is newly done up and has a very warm and welcoming feel to it.The staff is well verse with the menu and will sure guide and suggest you on what one must pick according to their taste plate. \nComing to what i called for \n\nSTARTED WITH \n\nBruschetta - The classic conti starter which is freshly baked bread grilled with garlic, olive oil,oregano topped with a generiois tooping of freshly cut tomatoes. (added a bit of parmesan grated to enhance tatse ).A good little starter if you looking to have a heavy main.\n\nMAIN FOCUS \n\nRavioli in Al Pesto Genovese - Ravioli  stuffed in panner and spanish (the filling was so yummy ) with a pesto sauce (option of saucy or dry is also give by the staff) which is freshly crushed basil tossed in garlic pine nut and again topped with parmesan.This dish is yummy cheese and too filling. \n\nSpaghetti - Aglio Olio E Peperoncino - The classic aglio olio tossed with Spaghetti was a outstanding dish for some one like me who prefers this dish simple less cheese and full of aromas of garlic chilly and parsley topped with oliver oil. \n\nTHIRSTY US \n\nTo acomapany my meal we  called for two mocktails Peach Please and Coke Float -  Both were perfect to its taste and very well presented.\n\nSWEET TOUCH \n\nTramissu - If you end your meal with a great desert the meal feels complete. And the tramissu we called for just did that.Freshly baked each morning as informed by team had the perfect balance of rum coffee vanila cream on the sponge cake topped with chocolate powder. Was over before a eye was winked. Highly recommended \n\nAll in all had a great dinning experience kudos to Sandeep Mandal and team who took prefect care of us and made sure we had a great Date. Looking forward to having more such great dinning experience at Little Italy Juhu....",

This brand has been around a good 15 years which is a statement in itself which means the food never disappoints. A few years ago during my earlier visits, the interiors were just average and it looks more like a traditional Indian AC restaurant. However, with the recent renovation, the place looks modern, trendy with the use of vibrant colors and greens.\n\nThe service is Usually of high standards and will not disappoint you. Valet service is available and a must around the busy lanes of heartland Juhu. We had tried the following dishes and got to say that each and every dish had its own story, taste, wonderful sourced ingredients and a beautiful presentation. The price was a bit steep for a VEG ONLY OUTLET, however, a fine dine and the location being Juhu you would expect something similar. \n\n▶Cheese Fondue - Melted Cheese in White Wine with Italia herbs served with Bread and Vegetables\n▶Sun Flower Pizza - A multi-grain Pizza base topped with Tomato sauce, Mozzarella Cheese, Grated Parmesan, Bell pepper cubes, Zucchini, Broccoli, Corn, Pine Nuts, Zatar Herb & Sunflower Seed\n▶Veg Falafel Roll - Served with some great Pita & Hummus, Leafy Veggies with Olives\n▶Pasta 4 Stagioni - A Creamy Tomato sauce with Garlic, Carrots, Cauliflower Capers, Olives, and Sundried Tomatoes\n▶Ferrero Rocher Mousse Cake - Delicate Mousse Cake with a 2 layered dark and light chocolate with hazelnut and cake sponge base\n▶Chocolate Bomb - Muddy melted fantasy Chocolate served with Vanilla Ice-cream\n\nSummary:\n▶Interiors – 5/5 \n▶Food – 5/5\n▶Service – 5/5\n▶Presentation – 5/5\n▶Quantity – 5/5\n▶Value F.Money – 5/5\n\nA beautiful business lunch which ended on a high note considering the desserts were also smashing...!!

The intercontinental food served here is really good. I'd personally recommend Tibetan Chicken Broth and Slow Cooked Chicken Breast. For cocktails, Sazerac is really good !\n\nOverall, a great experience, quality service and equally good food !",

The chef’s inventive twists are subtle and cleverly executed, sans any forced gimmicks. The 'Lemon Barley Salad' is crunchy, flavourful and enticingly presented. Among small plates, the vegetarian potsticker stands out owing to its delicate, but distinct flavours.",

The place can burn a small hole in your pocket and if you plan to have drinks too, then it might cost you a little fortune. Good stocked bar but accompaniments like fresh juice or canned juice without sugar were woefully missing and we find that atrocious, particularly when their pricey menu proclaims it to be high end restaurant. Four out of five stars is for good service, good ambience and good food. The one star less,  you know now why?",

Be it the food or the service, they won't let you down at all. Food is top-notch with maintained authenticity to it. The place is located just opposite Infinity Mall and upon entering this lovely dining place you can notice the huge space. It's more of fine dining with a range of food options. \n\nThey Al-a-carte as well as buffet style, so it's a personal choice with whatever is okay. \nWhen it comes to Asian food, they have great sushi options, mouth-watering dumplings, and scrumptious Thai delicacies. Also, they have introduced a new menu which I did try out and it was definitely one heavenly meal.\nGood portions to be precise, a single portion can be easily had by 2 people.\n\nStarted off with few portions of \n\"Pan Fried BBQ Fish\"\n\"Lemon Grass Prawns\"\n\"Coriander Chicken\" This was the best.\n\nEven tried a range of dumplings and I have a thing for it anyways. Gotta recommend the \"Philadelphia Cheese Dumplings\" & \"Pan Fried Japanese Mushroom Dumplings\". Kudos to the chef for making such amazing food.\n\nThe mains definitely had to tried and we had \"Lotus Leaf Rice\" accompanied by a decent portion of \"Chicken In Roasted Garlic Sauce\". Even tried a small portion of \"Singapore Style Fired Noddles with Bean Sprout\". A good amount of veggies, fabulous quantity, and the gravy complimented the rice and noodles. Worth it.\n\nWe finished our meal on a very sinful and decadent note with a huge portion of \"Chocolate Dome\". Well presented and extremely well crafted. For those who love chocolate, this is a definite pick for them.\n\nNothing to complain because everything was just perfect. It's the best place to land up for a good Asian experience.",

Their chips were super crispy and fresh and the salsa had the perfect amount of flavour. I also tried the cottage cheese grilled burrito which was delicious. They have recently started grilling all their burritos which makes all the difference! It brings out the flavour even more and I really enjoyed it. I also had the watermelon drink which was very refreshing and cooling. Their prices are also very reasonable for the quality of ingredients they provide.

The hygiene was not at all maintained and the ambiance is also not good. But I personally feel that if you would want to have breakfast out there the ambiance does not even matter. The taste is unmatchable I must say that. Moreover, the pricing is also quite cheap. I had the following items out there: \n1. Paneer Kulcha with Chole: Rs.70   \n2. Mix Aloo Kulcha: Rs.70\n3.

These two things that they serve are excellent, delicious and beyond comparison to any other outlet. If you can ignore the ambiance, visit this small restaurant. Otherwise, ordering from them is your best option and most people do order or pickup. \n\nDine in Rating of Maruti Pav Bhaji, Vile Parle:\n\nDate: 6th May 2019\nTime: 7:15pm\n\nPlease check the rating for each dish we ordered based on various factors:\n\n1) Black Pav Bhaji – Rs. 100\n\nQuality – 5/5\nPortion Size – 5/5\nTaste – 5/5\nValue for Money – 5/5\nOverall – 5/5\n\n2) Masala Pav – Rs. 50\n\nQuality – 5/5\nPortion Size – 5/5\nTaste – 5/5\nValue for Money – 5/5\nOverall – 5/5\n\nOther Factors:\n\nAmbiance: 2/5\nService: 3/5\n\nThe Black Pav Bhaji which is their specialty is super spicy, super delicious and one of the best versions of Pav Bhaji I have had. They do make less spicy version of the Black Pav Bhaji on request. The second must try dish is Masala Pav which is again spicy and contains lots of coriander. There is a burst of flavors in both the dishes and it will make you a fan of this place. You can also order just Black Bhaji along with Masala Pav instead of taking the plain Pav. The prices are super cheap and the food is worth every penny you pay for. Highly recommend this place for an absolutely unique experience. \n\nFollow us on Instagram: @foodratingsindia",

Very succulent salli boti stuffing inside the classic bun muska.\n\nMurg Gilafi Seekh: I love seekh kebabs, though I didn't quite like this one due to overload of ginger.\n\nKhade Masale ka Murg: a rich, medium spicy chicken gravy dish which I loved.

Loved the aromatic biryani with soft and delicious mutton pieces.

Not at all recommended here.\nOverall I loved the food. It was good. I had given special instructions not to make it too oily or too spicy and they prepared it accordingly. Good!",

I tried the following items:\n\nSalli Boti Bun Muska: this is a Parsi dish which I liked quite a lot. Very succulent salli boti stuffing inside the classic bun muska.\n\nMurg Gilafi Seekh: I love seekh kebabs, though I didn't quite like this one due to overload of ginger.\n\nKhade Masale ka Murg: a rich, medium spicy chicken gravy dish which I loved. Went well with butter rotis. Chicken chunks were quite tender and juicy.\n\nHyderabadi Mutton Dum Biryani: This was the best dish out of all. Loved the aromatic biryani with soft and delicious mutton pieces. Well balanced on spice.\n\nJalebi Rabri: Perfect end to a hearty meal with crispy jalebi and creamy rabri.\n\nThey had also provided mint chutney, raita and salad with the order. Thumbs up for that. Definitely gonna try out more items from the menu in future.",

It's the maximum you can go close to a khichdi at this place in Mumbai. \nIf you are fed-up of having dal khichdi in name of khichdi then this place is a must go. After that you may decide if u want to continue going to this place or not. But it's a must go for a one time experience. Who knows you may like the actual taste of khichdi.\nAll the best.",

And I was pleasantly surprised seeing the variety of khichdi options these guys have and thus ordered a Dal Makhani Khichdi with Boondi Raita as an add-on.\n\nComing to the package, they send the khichdi in a plastic container, the boondi raita in a real Matka and a small container containing green chutney. Coming to the Khichdi first, it tasted good. The rice and dal and the entire mixture were cooked properly and as it was a dal makhani khichdi I could see a nice layer of butter on top although it had melted completely due to the heat. The quantity was sufficient for a single person who is damn hungry or even for 2 people with medium appetite.\n\nComing to the Boondi raita, it was nice and it had a unique flavor to it and was nowhere near the boondi raita we generally eat. But the taste complemented the khichdi perfectly and so was the green chutney that came with the package. All in all the entire package at a cost of just Rs. 156 after discount from zomato was really good and all in all the taste was also satisfying.",

It's served in a very nice way with a lot of dry ice. Their cosmopolitan cocktails are also very good. Though if you want to have a good time you can always walk to house of nomad which is literally next to ming yang. Lastly, their chocolate truffle cake is also quite good.

It was simply amazing . With jowar bhakri i tried mutton saoji and loved it like anything . Then tried chicken saoji which was good too. But would give mutton saoji 5/5 . Must try here. At the end we went for buttermilk . Don't go for very spicy since medium spicy is 🔥 enough . Overall 4/5. All 4 points goes to the food . One point deducted for service which is less than average.

People who love very spicy food (like which is served in vidarbha region) so really visit. People preferring less spice food should try it once( you never know, what will you like) The food is delicious and served very well, the staff is good and is friendly. The overall its a little high budget and would not come under a pocket friendly window. So folks who like to spend your weekends eating here beware as the food is really spice (can make you cry) so think or taste before you enjoy your weekend. The place can be found from the road itself but though the lane is usually crowded. The must visit place in a while.",

You will also find a big modak carved at the top of the restaurant.\n\nModakam is situated right outside the iconic and famous Shree Siddhivinayak Ganapati Mandir. The temple has its foundation 2 centuries ago on 19th November, 1801. A small temple has now turned into a grand premise housing many deities. The Siddhivinayak Ganesha idol is quite unique and unusual as it was carved out of a single black stone and has Ganesha’s trunk to the right instead of left.\n\nThe temple is situated in the heart of city Mumbai. Centrally located and easily accessible via various public transport services.\n\nModakam is a pure vegetarian restaurant with multiple fast food options. It serves variety of maharashtrian, south Indian and Punjabi cuisines. They also specialize into fasting food items as well.\n\nStarters :\n\nKOTHAMBIR WADI, an authentic maharashtrian dish, had a beautiful colour of green and brown. Fried perfectly to make the outer layer crisp. Served along with coriander chutney and ketchup. A must-have!!!\n\nCHEESE PAKODA, one of the most delicious snack dishes, were bought hot from the kitchen. Crispy layer outside and melting cheese on the inside was a perfect mix.\n\nMain course:\n\nRestaurant has a live PAV BHAJI counter right at its entrance. The aroma of pav bhaji fills the ambience and you can’t hold back in ordering one. The dish surpasses the expectations.\n\nMany devotees come walking to the temple from different parts of Bombay and haven’t eaten anything till the darshan is over. Hearty meal of PANEER TIKKA MASALA AND ROTI is a big recommendation to anyone looking for a full family meal. After all the hard work, pamper your system with some protein.\n\nJuices/Milkshakes:\n\nKing of fruits and yogurt, tongue’s delight is MANGO LASSI. Perfectly sweetened, not too thick nor too thin is a healthy smoothie along with food.\n\nHow about a feast for your eyes and taste buds? A must try is ROSE FALOODA. Modakam also adds chunks of jelly pieces. Kind of took me back to my childhood days.\n\nDesserts:\n\nEver thought of a spicy ice cream? GUAVA ICE CREAM with sprinkle of chilli powder was a blast of taste’s in the mouth. It is a wonderful mix of sweet and spicy (very little). Almost felt like eating guava fruit with masala.\n\nModakam aaye aur Modak nahi khaya toh kya khaya? But how about modak with a twist – MODAK ICE CREAM. It is unique and different. Modakam’s speciality.\n\nSo overall it was a good experience with multiple flavours... Service is quick & rates are reasonable.. Definitely a good option for some quick snacking with family & friends.\n\nDo come for darshan and a hearty meal.",

The quantity was extremely good and the quality was also decent. I haven't visited the outlet to comment on the ambiance and staff. \n\nThis is what I tried in my online order:\n\n1. Veg Triple schezwan rice: \n3*/5\nThe schezwan rice was cooked well and it was very tasty. The veg gravy had all the veggies and it was tasty too. The only thing was that I found the gravy to be extremely spicy otherwise it was a very good dish. \n\n2. Veg Flat Malaysian Noodles:\n4*/5\nThis was very tasty the flat Malaysian noodles was cooked to perfection,it was stir fried and tossed with garlic, sprouts and spinach. Recommended if you like Malaysian noodles. \n\nThey also gave extra schezwan sauces and fried noodles both were very good. Fried noodles were nice and crisp. \n\nMy Experience \n\nDelivery: On time\nFood taste: Good \nQuantity: Excellent \nQuality: Good\nCuisine: Indo Chinese \nPrice: Inexpensive to Moderate \nService: Good\nOverall value for money is actually 3.5* to 4*/5 but because the triple schezwan gravy was too spicy for my taste buds giving it a 3*/5.",

For me - being a true Mumbaikar, I was a bit skeptical to try out the freshwater fishes and mustard oil preparation of Bengali cuisine. But so impressed I was, after having a feast at Oh! Calcutta.\nTo begin with, they have a well kept and professional Valet Parking - which is such a necessity - in the cramped Tardeo area. Once you enter the restaurant - the seating and interiors of the restaurant are a mix of traditional and modern, to make you feel at comfort. For menu card - they provide you a Tablet phone, where you can view how the dish looks like, before you order.\nWell, we feasted on a variety of dishes - each better than the other and it's difficult to call out a favourite.\nNizami Murgh Malai Tikka - Delicious chicken malai tikka\nGondhoraj Mach - Steamed fish in leaves\nTopsher Cutlet - Mango fish cutlet\nKosha Mangsho - Sukka Mutton\nDaab Chingri - Prawns cooked in coconut milk and served artistically in a coconut\nRui Kalia - Rui fish in traditional bay leaf and garam masala curry\nHot puffy Luchi - Piping hot and puffy puri  \nCalcutta Chicken Biryani\nMishti Doi - famous bengali sweet and creamy yoghurt\nRosogulla - needs no description\nGur Sondesh\nSo all you Mumbaikars, if you want a taste of Bengal, you don't need to travel all the way to Kolkata. You have right here in Mumbai - Oh Calcutta!",

The set-up is comfortable with dim lights and earthy interiors, with a beautiful bar at the centre. Perfect place for a date night.\n\nThis place is located at Union Park, off carter road Khar West. This place has both outdoor and indoor seating arrangement. The outdoors is quite pleasant and better for smokers. They also serve European and American cuisine.\n\nWhat I tried:\n\nHoney Garlic Prawns: It was cooked to perfection and yet balanced with the flavors. It was just melt in mouth.\n\nGruyere Stuffed Wings: It was treat to devour.\n\nCheese Garlic Bread: The amount of cheese was actually good as cheese was the USP of this dish. You could actually feel the softness of the cheese and though the cheese pull was amazing.\n\nWhite Sauce Pasta: The pasta was decent and with generous portions.\n\nChocolate Caramel Sandwich: It was delicious indulgence which you cannot skip.\n\nThis place has marked a special place in the list of restaurants where I would love to visit again. If you have not been here, then you are certainly missing out on some real stuff.\n\nFood: 4/5\n\nService: 5/5\n\nDecor: 5/5\n\nP.S: This review is strictly depending on my personal experience.",

They serve some tasty starters, mains and alot more. \n\nTo start off with, we had:\n-Bharwan Mushroom Tikka : These were some soft mushrooms marinated in tikka masala and served with grilled capsicum bits and onion along with a spicy yet delicious chutney. Not to forget the mushrooms were filled with cheese and hence were really yummy! A must try definitely. \n\n-Daal Makhani :Daal makhani was fine. Not the best I've had but a nice dish to try out with their delectable naans. \n\n-Shah Jahani Biryani. : \nSpicy Biryani rice mixed with veggies and paneer was delicious. Not a fan of Vegetable Biryani but this was great especially when savored with Dahi Boondi. \n\n-Subzi Panchali: \nHad fine vegetables in them but too oily. The taste wasn't something to brag about. \n\n-Paneer Lababdar : \nProbably a dish paneer lovers would look forward to. Personally I didn't find this all too appetizing. But no harm in trying it out. \n\n-Chilli Cheeze Naan:\nWell the best naans ever. They were basically butter naan filled with cheese and chilli flakes. The perfect naans to have with the gravy dishes. \n\nAll in all, a nice place to order vegetarian dishes. What I liked about them was that the delivery was made on time. The quantity of the dishes was decent. A fine place to try out Indian dishes.",

So the first points are for zomato for the discount and super fast delivery.\n\nComing to the order, I had ordered an Aloo Paratha Chole Combo. Coming to the entire package it contained 2 Aloo Parathas, one box of chole and one small box of Boondi Raita. The aloo parathas were just awesome. Properly wrapped in the silver foil paper and they were cut into half. The aloo parathas tasted just perfect being that they were not too spicy and neither were they overcooked. Just perfect. The best part was that they did not put any chilies according to the special instructions. The parathas themselves were so thick that it became difficult to go beyond one and a half with all the chole and boondi raita.\n\nComing to the chole, the gravy was really tasty not too oily and contained nice amounts of chole. The chole were also properly cooked and it perfectly complemented the parathas. The chole was a bit on the spicier side. Coming to the boondi raita it was also good. The curd was thick and fresh and the best part was it was not even a bit sour. The boondi had been properly dipped in the curd and had become soft which was good. And since it was served cold it did have a soothing effect on eating the hot parathas and spicy chole.\n\nAll in all the items were really good. The packing and all was also perfect. Would definitely recommend to try these parathas. Just super good and tasty",

Along with the paratha I received jeera rice, dal makhni, butter paneer gravy, raita, papad and gulab jamun. Price of this box is 240 and I believe 2 people can share it. The rest of the things like dal rice gravy are one person quantity but a stuffed paratha with it makes it difficult for a single person to finish. According to me this meal box was worth every penny.

Also, all the dishes were packaged to perfection, zero leaks and in a durable container. Hot and ready to be consumed.\n\nLamb Schezwan, tender lamb pieces covered in with the spiciest schezwan sauce. the dish had it uniqueness and liked the overall taste. people who prefer spicy should definitely go for this option. Chicken in Green Garlic Sauce, was a little subdued in taste not quite interesting but had a decent taste. Prawns Burnt Garlic Rice was heavenly, rich in flavour and spices and the in every bite I had prawns getting in, Good quanity and quality as well. Chicken Chowmein, was for by far the best of the lot, very subtle and calms your hunger with its chicken stock. noodles was cooked perfectly and all the veggies tossed really brought this dish to life.\n\nOverall a great experience.\n\nMust Try!",

And across the road the sea view is simply breathtaking. Ofcourse can't do any of it now due to lockdown but can definitely relive the moments by ordering their food!\n\nSo we called for the super famous Bombay Masala Pizza. Well my family members just love this pizza. No complaints from my side as such, the base is superb sauces good! But not me personal favourite. I found the packaging of the pizza box was really good though. So in terms of safety and hygiene, full marks! We also called for the Falafel with Hummus and Corn Fritters. I infact loved both these sides more than the pizza! So it was a win win for the entire family! Look forward to restaurant dine in opening up now, so can recreate those special moments with loved ones at Pizza By The Bay!",

I had sandwich and aloo parathas in this cafe and it was lip smacking. I just loved it and always crave for them. The only problem I found was the waiting. It is too long during peak hours. It can go up till an hour. And you have to share a table with strangers which might kind of invade your privacy. Rest everything is amazing. It's a good place to visit for having a light dinner. Sometimes you may also come across a live performance going on which is a cherry on top of the cake for it's ambience.",

Appetisers as well as drinks were brought to the table frequently and any other request was carried out within minutes. Efficient & well trained staff.\nThe appetisers were better than the main course but I was a tad disappointed. The Punjabi fare here wasn't as good as that in Punjab or even Delhi. Though most places in Bombay don't do well with Punjabi cuisine, I expected Punjab grill to be able to provide an authentic experience in terms of the taste of Punjabi food.\nThe positive was that they had plenty of variety. Lots of options for appetisers, chaat, salads, main course, desserts, etc. A good selection of pickles and condiments as well, especially the lime pickle & the papaya chutney. That they had a lot of non-vegetarian items on offer another big plus.",

The aroma of the biryani was very tempting. The chicken was finger licking deliciously spicy, marinated in spicy yoghurt mixture and grilled. Quantity was good and Biryani was Authentic!\n\nIn Desserts, I ordered Kesar Phirni - best way to end a heavy meal as it is super light and healthy. Delicious! 😋\n\nSERVICE:\nDelivery was not on time for some reason and I had to wait for so long, but the owner apologized for the same. They also delivered the dessert later as they forget to pack it on first place. However, packaging was good though and the food was delivered hot.\n\nRATINGS:\nFOOD: 4/5\nSERVICE: 3/5\nVALUE FOR MONEY: 4/5\nOVERALL: 3.5/5",

Even I though I live overseas now, I found my self helplessly drawn to Salt Water Cafe without hesitation or second thought. The menu has remained largely similar with some brilliant new additions. The spaghettini has been my go to food for every type of lunch or dinner setting and the recipe is still authentic and refreshing. I was so pleased to be remembered by the staff there who offered a warm welcome and flawless service. Their loyalty program is very customer centric which makes it unique and enjoyable. In my day of living in Mumbai (Bandra), I have had breakfast lunch and dinner at Salt Water and would do it many times over if the future gives me an opportunity to do so!",

Had to ask 3-4 times for starters and had to wait for 10-15 mins in between meals for food as well as for something as basic as a spoon. On top of it, they didn't serve all the starters especially the chat. Considering they charge Rs.900 for a veg buffet, it's totally unacceptable. You can get better food and service elsewhere in that price. Only for one time visit. \n\nCheers!",

I didn't fancy the chilla, found it a bit tasteless.\nFor the main course we ordered matar poori with dahiwale aloo and gatte ki subzi with masala satpadi. The matar poori had a good amount of mashed peas in them, which was quite nice to discover when one pulled a piece off. The gatte ki subzi was splendid. The chutneys were also very good, especially the sweet one\nThe place had absolutely no ambience to speak of but it was neat and clean.

The best choice of the day. A tad bit oily, but so is the traditional preparation. A dark red, garlicky, tangy gravy with prawns. \nThe goan prawn curry with rice was heartwarming comfort food in a bowl. It was slightly lacking seasoning but nothing a little shake of salt couldnt fix. The gravy was velvety and rich with a good amount of baby prawns served with steamed rice.\n\nThe ambience however, is the reason for my below par rating. Has some peculiar smell. Is quite dingy and the AC smells musty. Not very pleasing. But the food is pretty good and is worth a visit if in pali!",

The staff is quite good and service is quick too (provided there is not heavy rush which is found mostly on weekend nights). Some of the dishes that I recommend are:\n\n-Veg Spring Roll: Crisp and properly fried. It has perfect blend of vegetables. Schezwan chutney served with it is very tasty.\n\n-Paneer Kolhapuri: The flavour of 'kolhapuri masala' can be strongly felt. It gives the unique rustic taste to the dish\n\n-Veg Manchurian: Manchurian balls taste different and heavenly. They are more crispy and flavourful than usually served in other restaurants\n\n-Shahi Biryani: This special type of biryani is made with fresh garam masala and topped with fried onions. It is served with Raita and green peas gravy\n\n-Pav Bhaji: It just tastes like any other Pav Bhaji. It is really tasty though. But nothing unique about it.",

Dosa served with gravy Manchurian, coconut chutney and schezwan sauce. Tastes goes along very well.\n2. Jini Dosa:\nThe famous jini dosa, which has a feeling of paneer and other veggies.

Paneer Tikka was a big let down as it was too bland. The Dal Bukhara was very well made along with sarson da saag and makkai roti. Prawns was missing from the menu which is surprising as most buffet places have it in their menu.\n\nThe ambiance is good and there is live Bhangra every 30-40 mins which makes the place very lively and people are often seen shaking a leg.\nThe staff was very supportive and polite. A few changes in the menu would surely make this a great place.",

One could walk to the chat counter and enjoy your chat at the counter, as if enjoying street food. Or you can ask it to be served on your table. \nThis was followed by starters which were served on the table. There was choice of 5 starters and it would be served unlimited. Same was for chass / lassi.\nThe lunch buffet spread was limited but good. Different roti / paratha options were available and we're served fresh from the kitchen. \nThe desert options were good. Indian desserts are anyway irresistible, and that's exactly what it was here.\nThe staff was courteous. The service was good, but have been a bit faster. The ambience and music was good. Bollywood Punjabi music was playing in the background.",

It's so peaceful to just watch the view and have a lovely Dining experience.\n\nWe opted for the Lunch Buffet and left very much happy with our Experience. They have such a widespread Buffet for the visitors. The Food is the best hands down.\n\n***APPETIZERS***\n\nThe Soups and Appetizers came to the Table. A very few limited options but very yummy and delicious. I loved the Shorba and the appetizers.\n\n***BUFFET***\n\nI tried different option from the Salad Bar, the Bakery, Main course and the Dessert options. I loved the following dishes a lot.\n\nCrab Sushi: A big fan of Sushi and this was one of the best.\n\nChicken Pepper Salami: Lovely salami with a hint of pepper.\n\nBengali Chicken Curry: This was an authentic Bengali curry with delicious Chicken pieces.\n\nPaan Cheesecake: My Dessert as well as dish of the day. Wow this was such a unique and mouthwatering dessert. I was simply floored by this Cheesecake.\n\nI definitely recommend this place for Buffet Lovers.\n\nFood: 5/5\nStaff: 5/5\nAmbience: 5/5\nValue for Money: 4/5",

So I am always looking to try new places that serve this cuisine because it’s my comfort food.\nRecently came across Bohri Kitchen and ordered-\n\n1. Paneer and Peanut Samosas- Crisp Samosas stuffed with a filling of paneer and peanut. When I first saw this on the menu, I was a bit apprehensive about how it will be, but I was tempted to try it because i wanted to taste how these two ingredients would go along. And to my surprise, the samosas tasted really nice, the combination really worked. \n2. Cheese Corn Cutlets- They were size of my palm, they tasted really nice. The saltiness of cheese and sweetness of corn was a good blend. The crust of the cutlet was not crisp and the binding was not in place. Taste was on point, the crust can be worked on and made more crisp. \n3. Mom’s special Paneer and Veggie Biryani- just like the name says, it really tastes like it’s homemade, very less oil, packed with veggies and paneer and perfectly spiced. \n4. Mom’s Caramel Custard- it was well set, the texture was really good and had the right amount of sugar. A very light and delicious dessert. \nI am a vegetarian so the options for me were a little limited, but if you eat non-veg, you should definitely check out their menu.",

Tur Dal & Jeera Patti samosa \n\nIngredient mix blended perfectly & Each portion offers 4 small pcs which are mild in taste. Have it with the theekha and Meetha chutney provides. It tastes much better. \n\n2. Cheese Corn Cutlets \n\n1 portion offers 2 big pieces. Cutlet’s outer layer was crispy and inside it was soft with cheese and corn combined which oozed out and made it yummy 😋 \n\n3. Mom’s Paneer Veg Biryani\nBohri kitchen is known to serve delicious biryani’s and when I opened the box I could see why. It looked and tasted divine. \nThe flavours were well balanced and paneer was a nice mix to it. \nRich in texture, flavour & taste this dish is highly recommended. They serve curd/ raita too. \n\n4. Gulab Jamun \nPerfect way to end my dinner with some meetha in the form of Gulab Jamun. Soft, tasty and sweet ( just the way I like it ). \n\nOne thing Bohri Kitchen needs to work on is the quantity / portion size of the quick bites which I felt was less for the price.\n\nAll in all a great delivery place to order some tasty food.",

From what I gathered by reading through reviews my expectations were possibly placed differently. The food presentation was top notch but the quantity left a little more to be desired. I understand the nuances of fine dining but I believe that portion sizes shouldn’t be abysmally small for the price any place charges. We were a group of four and all four of us felt the same and therefore we made a quick exit. Had a couple of chhotas (their version of bar bites) then an appetizer or two and a couple of drinks. Ambience and presentation were definitely beyond comparison but as I said earlier the portion size and relative pricing leave a significant room for improvement.",

We ordered a salad called White Queen's Guilty Pleasure and the first ingredient written below was potato but what came to our table had not a single speck of potato. When we quizzed the waiter, first he confidently said that this salad doesn't come with potatoes. We showed him the menu card and then he thought for a moment and said that customers complained and so they have stopped giving potato in this particular salad. Hilarious, isn't it? So these little things are what completely ruins a great restaurant experience. Anyway, the food here is really good, especially the tenderloin items. And they've got a lovely outdoor sitting setup, which you'll prefer because the staff is always chatting inside.",

Being from Calcutta , I can assure you , this place just takes you to all those places in Kolkata where you might have had mutton, fish , chicken , biriyani  etc . Even if you're not from calcutta or not a bong you will relish all the dishes they offer you at such rates. \nThough found golbari mutton not equal to the dish it refers to , still tasteful enough to tickle your taste buds . luchi/Puri, I think is pretty round and fluffy.,except the price is slightly on the higher side for a bong like me , who's regular diet is luchi and don't feel like paying 99 bucks for 4 pieces of it. \nWould suggest not to try mishti doi / dahi untill and unless it's fresh . As it is sweet curd , it should not  be old and go on to higher fermentation , which makes it sour .\nStill , as I have said earier , the space having all Calcutta like images and good choice of old Bengali music , will take you back and may make  you nostalgic and sad . But the food will surely bring you back to reality and give you a sensation of eternal happiness which is filled with lots of mishti doi and patishapta .\n\nPlease visit and enjoy the eternal delicacy of Bengal.",

This time, we visited their Andheri outlet and it is slightly bigger than the other outlets we have visited. We seated ourselves in their casual but cool ambience and moved onto ordering dishes from a lot of sections.\n\nWe started off with the Broccoli Cheese soup. This soup was served in a mug and looked creamy. The aroma was soothing and as we sipped onto it, we realized that it was indeed food for the soul. There were tiny bits of broccoli along with other veggies and a hint of oregano with a cheesy texture. It was just amazing.\n\nNext one was the Cheese Garlic Bread. This one was made on the base of a rusk like bread. It was thick and had a hint of sweetness. It was topped with a bed of cheese and garlic with a generous amount of butter. The topping was good but the proportions were not balanced. They could probably use a different kind of bread as a base for this one.\n\nThe Quattro Formage Pesto Risotto was absolutely heavenly. Quattro Fromage essentially means four cheese and this dish was true to its name. The refreshing flavor of basil pesto along with the filling texture of cheese made this one just perfect. It was served with a side of garlic bread which sort of complemented the dish and completed it as well. It was one of the best pesto risottos that we have had.\n\nThe Margherita Wheat Wafer Pizza over here has great flavor. It had a tangy base of Marguerite sauce over a paper thin wafer. It was flavored with basil and a balance of tomato and cheese. The taste is amazing here but the quantity of this one was quite less for the price. They could work on that for sure.\n\nLastly, we ended our meal with the Brownie shake. The brownie shake was loaded with chocolate and brownie crumbs. It was topped with chocolate sauce and was frothy and chilling. It was cool and good. The place serves some of the best pastas and risottos. If you are looking for a soulful delight while enjoying these, you should definitely try this one out!\n\nAmbience: 3/5\nFood: 4/5\nService: 4/5",

This one is newly opened hence not very crowded, yet!\nItalian food is favourite hence I am quite fussy when the experience is not right, Italy in a box on the other hand was a great experience.\nWhat draws your attention first is an amazing interior of this place and the boxes in which they serve food.\nThough it looks small, mind you the quantity is quite filling (I am dead serious about this)\nFood that we tried\nPremivera piquante pink sauce rissoto - Spicy yet filled with flavours. This was undoubtedly the best and you should not miss it! \nQuottro formage - as the name suggests it comes with white sauce made up of 4 types of cheese. Try it only if you like cheese. Needless to say I LOVE cheese hence loved this pasta! \nPesto pizza - the unique point about their pizza is the crust!\nIt's a 7\" pizza sufficient for one person. If you like thin wafer crusts, this one is just a star in the menu! Choose only 2-3 toppings. I added 5 which overpowered the taste of pesto sauce.\nDesserts - in desserts we tried brownie which was good!\nNutella shake - this one was surprisingly good. Not too sweet and you get to enjoy it without facing 'on your face' kind of a sweetness.\n\nService and cost wise Italy in a box is definitely good! If you love Italian food I am sure you would love this.",

Finally got an opportunity to visit The Oriental Blossom and we were lucky enough to visit during the Claypot Menu which is being done in the month of August.\n\nIt's located in the Hotel Marine Plaza exactly opposite Marine Drive. You get to dine with a beautiful view of the sea. The ambience is super just like a Chinese diner.\n\nThe Staff is excellent and very efficient. Stud Vijay attended our table and helped us choose some really good dishes from the Menu.\n\n***Cocktails***\n\nWe tried Chandon Delice and Chandon Mojito. Two amazing Wine drinks made using the special Chandon Sparkling Wine.\n\n***Appetizers***\n\nWe tried a variety of dishes like Dumplings, Prawns in Salt & Pepper, Fillet Pomfret Garlic Chilly and Crispy Schezwan Lamb. We loved the dumplings especially the Prawns variant and also Prawns and Lamb appetizers.\n\n***Main Course***\n\nAnd finally the main thing that we loved here were their Claypots. We tried Braised Pomfret Claypot and Prosperity Chicken Claypot in XO Sauce. Two equally different but amazing dishes. \n\n***Desserts***\n\nDesserts were a perfect end to one of the best Lunch that I have had in recent times. We tried the Philadelphia Cheesecake and Kahlua Triamisu. Both the deseertst were simply delicious and mind-blowing.\n\nI surely recommend Chinese Food Lovers to visit The Oriental Blossom in the month of August to try their Claypots.\n\nFood: 5/5\nStaff: 5/5\nAmbience: 5/5\nValue for Money: 5/5",

Everything suggested by them turned out really good. We had the yam cutlets and molagapodi idli for starters, both were very well made. But the highlight is the main course where they offer you a platter with all their Gravy and rice varieties and you can choose the main course by tasting. Then they tell what they can make with the gravy. The dish turned out super delicious and we ended the meal with their kheer which was an apt end to a great meal!",

The waiter even helped me out with ordering their best dishes. Overall its a very good joint for snacking. Really recommend it to everyone.",

The best part about lies in the fact that it is quiet. Apart from the non-blaring music, you can eat in peace.\n\nThere isn't much of a staff here, so the service is quite personal with the owners, who suggest the appropriate dishes and the quantity you need to order.\n\nPlus point to the portion sizes and the subsequent cost, which makes this place a value for money joint.",

The sauces are well amalgamated and humbly served to you. I tried the Cheese Burst fries and Cheese Poppers fries. The former being mid spicy and yummy, the latter has a lil extra dash of spice and gooey cheese! After having such mouth watering, delicious and hot fries, you can cool off with a Kit-Kat milkshake! I actually saw the chef making the shake and he generously added the chocolates in it, making it delectable! The place is pretty small and the sitting arrangements kills the ambience. That's the only thing that will make you cringe; otherwise you won't have any complains regarding the food! According to my appetite, it was more than enough!",

Manager is very kind and humble. They also serve half the quantity which is a nice idea. Food is very tasty. We tried Manchow soup and Dragon Chicken in starters, quantity was enough to fill half the stomachs of our two. In Mains, we tried half Chicken Shezwan Noodles, unlike other restaurants, noodles were totally covered with sauce, veggies, egg and chicken which I liked the most. Chicken Burnt Chilli Sauce was like a cherry on the cake to have it with the noodles for perfect sweet and chilli taste. Please check pictures for presentation and quantity",

That's all there is when it comes to the plus points.\n\nWe went for the steamed veg as well as paneer momos along with the fried veg momos. None of the momos were seasoned properly. You have to heavily depend on the dipping sauces to enjoy this. The fried momos are slightly better. \n\nOne of the major problems is the execution of the momos. The top hasn't been stretched properly enough which ends up leaving a doughy feel as you bite into one. Other than a complete lack of seasoning, the filling was left uncooked within some momos.\n\nYou can say that you get what you pay for but I've experienced amazing food at the same price range. Avoid  Yummy Momos if you enjoy good quality food.",

I've always loved Zaffran's food when it comes to Non Vegetarian. \nSince Shravan was going on, I decided to order Veg from here because I thought I should try it out. It takes immense pleasure for me to say, I LOVED IT SO MUCH!!!!\nIt was totally worth ordering from here. Going ahead with what I ordered : \n\n• Veg Galouti Kebab (4/5): Absolutely loved these!!! They were so melt-in-mouth kinda soft and delicious. Really good alternative for your Mutton Galouti Kebabs😋\n\n• Achari Paneer Tikka (3/5): So this was a main course. Had this with Roti & Naan. The taste was obviously Achari kinda. Really creamy gravy & a decent one!\n \n• Dum Subz Handi (5/5) : This was again a maincourse. Had this with Roti and Naan as well. This was loaded with veggies and paneer, just exactly the way I love it. Was a bit spicy but that totally improved the taste❤️\n\n• Dal Makhani (4/5): I ordered this with steam rice (ofcourse). It was buttery and thick. A bit sweet but was really really delicious 😋\n\nIt was such nicely packed, felt so safe while accepting the delivery of this food. It's a must try outlet, not only for Non Veg food but also Veg. \n\nCheers🍻",
